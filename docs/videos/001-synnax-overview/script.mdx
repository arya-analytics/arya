Hey everyone, my name is Emiliano, and I'm one of the founders of Synnax. Over the
course of the next few videos, I'll be walking you through all the steps you need to
productively instrument and operate hardware using our platform.

In this first video, I'll be giving you a high-level overview of what Synnax is,
how it works, and why it's different from other solutions out there.

Synnax is software for instrumenting and operating hardware systems. Our components help
you:

1. Integrate data acquisition and control devices.
2. Visualize real-time and historical telemetry.
3. Manually control actuators, and write sequences to automate repetitive and time-critical tasks.

The first is to store data. This includes includes sensor and actuator data, as well as
operational meta-data, such as configuration information, data review results, and more.

The second is to move data in near real-time between all of the external components
that depend on it. This includes visualizations within the Synnax console, device
drivers, control sequences, and any other system that might need access to sensor data.
