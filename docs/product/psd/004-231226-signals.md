# 0 - Summary

Our core vision is to reduce the cycle time between acquiring data and using it to
make meaningful decisions. One of the essential workflows that makes this possible is
automated analysis based on changes to sensor values and/or cluster state.

Receiving detailed analysis in five instead of thirty minutes can make a successful
test campaign. In this PSD we examine methods for introducing intuitive, automated
analysis into Synnax.
