Streaming telemetry is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and monitoring.
This page guides you through using the Typescript client to stream telemetry from a 
Synnax cluster.

## Simple Example

To start streaming data, call the `telem.newStreamer` method on the client and provide
a list of channels to stream.

```typescript
const streamer = await client.telem.newStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
```

Then, read the next incoming telemetry frame, call the `read` method on the streamer.

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
```

This call will block until a new frame is available. This frame **may not contain data
for every channel specified**. For example, if we're reading from two sensors that
are being sampled by different devices at different rates, we may receive a frame
containing data only for the first channel, followed by a frame containing data only
for the second channel.

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on the
streamer to release the network connection and other related resources. 

```typescript
streamer.close();
```

## Using an Async For Loop

The streamer implements an async iterator, which can be useful for continuously 
processing incoming frames of telemetry.

```typescript
for await (const frame of streamer) {
  // Process the frame
}
```
