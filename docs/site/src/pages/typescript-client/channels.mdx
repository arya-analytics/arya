The Typescript client provides interfaces for creating, retrieving and reading data from
channels in a Synnax cluster. In this guide, we'll cover the details of each of these 
operations.

If you're unfamiliar with what channels are and how they work, check out the 
of [channels concepts guide](/concepts/channels).

## Creating Channels

To create channels, we can use the `.channels.create` method on the Synnax client.

#### Creating a single, fixed rate channel

The simplest channel to create stores samples at a fixed rate.

```typescript
import { DataType, Rate } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const myTemperatureSensor = client.channels.create({
    name: "my_temperature_sensor",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    rate: Rate.hz(1)
});
```

## Creating an indexed channel and its index

Creating variable rate channels first requires us to create an index channel to store 
timestamps.

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeIndexChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const myTemperatureSensor = await client.channels.create({
    name: "my_temperature_sensor",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeIndexChannel.key
});
```

Notice how we set the `isIndex` property to `true` on the time channel. This tells 
Synnax that this channel will be used to store timestamps for other channels. We then
pass the `index` property to the temperature sensor channel to tell Synnax to use the
time channel as its index.

## Retrieving Channels

Like creating them, we can retrieve channels using the `channels.retrieve` method on 
the client.

### Retrieving a single channel

To retrieve a single channel, we can pass the channel's name or key to the `retrieve` 
method.

```typescript
// By name
const myTemperatureSensor = await client.channels.retrieve("my_temperature_sensor");
// If you know the key, you can use that too
const myTemperatureSensor = await client.channels.retrieve(myTemperatureSensor.key);
```

If Synnax finds no channels matching the query, the client will raise a `NoResultsError`.
If more than one channel matches the query, the client will raise a `MultipleResultsError`. 
If you'd like to accept no or multiple results, provide a list to the `retrieve` method
as shown in the next section.

### Retrieving multiple channels

We can also retrieve multiple channels by passing a list of names or keys to the 
`retrieve` method.

```typescript
// By name
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve(["my_temperature_sensor", "time"]);
// By key
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve([myTemperatureSensor.key, timeIndexChannel.key]);
// This won't work!!
const channels = await client.channels.retrieve(["my_temperature_sensor", timeIndexChannel.key]);
```

Note that Synnax will not raise a `NoResultsError` if no channels match the query. Instead,
it will simply omit that channel from the list of results.

## Next Steps

Now that we know how to create and retrieve channels, we can start reading and writing
data to them. Check out the [reading telemetry](/typescript-client/read-telemetry)
and [writing telemetry](/typescript-client/write-telemetry) guides to learn more.
