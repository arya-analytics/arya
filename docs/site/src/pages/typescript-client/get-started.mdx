## Installation

The typescript client is available on npm, and can be installed with your package 
manager of choice. We'll be using `npm` in our documentation, but feel free to use
`yarn`, `pnpm`, or any other package manager you prefer.

```bash
npm install @synnaxlabs/client
```

## Authenticating with a Cluster

To authenticate with a Synnax cluster, simply instantiate a new client with your 
connection parameters and credentials.

```typescript
import { Synnax } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax({
    host: "demo.synnaxlabs.com",
    port: 9090,
    username: "synnax",
    password: "seldon",
    secure: true,
});
```

Here's a breakdown of the parameters you can pass to the client:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `host` | The hostname of the Synnax cluster | `localhost` |
| `port` | The port of the Synnax cluster | `9090` |
| `username` | The username to authenticate with | `""` |
| `password` | The password to authenticate with | `""` |
| `secure` | Whether to use TLS encryption. This should be set to `true` if the cluster is using TLS. See [production](/deployment/production) for more information. | `false` |

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed and authenticated the client, you're ready to start using Synnax!

how to create channels and retrieve data from them.
