description: "Use the Typescript Client to read from a Synnax cluster"
---

The Typescript client supports several different ways of reading data from a cluster. We
can read directly from a channel, or use iterators for processing large queries.

## Reading from a Channel

The simplest way to read data from Synnax is to use the `read` method that is available
on a channel.

```typescript

const channel = await client.channels.retrieve("temperature");
const start = new Date('2023-02-12T12:30:00Z');
const end = new Date('2022-02-12T14:30:00Z');

const data = await channel.read(start, end);
```

## Reading from Multiple Channels

We can also read from mulitple channels at once by calling the `telem.read` method on
the client. This method takes a list of channel names/keys and a time range.

```typescript
const frame = await client.telem.read(["temperature", "humidity"], start, end);
```
