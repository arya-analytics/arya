When analyzing data, it's common to fetch a particular channel and read a subset of it's
data. This page shows you different methods for retrieving channels.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you’ve already:

1. [Started a Synnax cluster](/deploy/get-started)
2. [Familiarized yourself with channels](/concepts/channels)
3. [Installed the Synnax client in a language of your choice](/analyze/get-started)

### Retrieving a Single Channel

Retrieving a single channel is easy.

```python
# By name
my_precise_tc = client.channels.retrieve("my-precise-tc")
# If you know the key, you can also retrieve by key
my_precise_tc = client.channels.retrieve(my_precise_tc.key)
```

If Synnax finds no or multiple channels matching the query parameters, the client will
raise a `QueryError`.

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

Retrieving multiple channels is also simple. All of the following queries return
the same channels.

```python
# By name
channels = client.channels.retrieve(["sensor-one", "sensor-three"])

# As with above, if you know the keys, you can also retrieve by them
channels = client.channels.retrieve([ch.key for ch in channels])
```

Unlike retrieving a single channel, retrieving several channels will <b>not</b> raise a
`QueryError` when no or multiple channels are found for a given parameter. If no results
match, the method will return an empty list. 

### Retrieving a Channel using a Range

If you've queried a [range](/analyze/access-ranges), you can access it's channels using
Python's dictionary (`[]`) syntax, or as a property:

```python
# Retrieve the range - see the highlighted link above for how these work
bike_outing = client.ranges.retrieve("02/22/23 Cycling")

# Grab a channel
ch = bike_outing["sensor_one"]
# Or like this
ch = bike_outing.sensor_one
```

### Retrieving a Single Channel

Retrieving a single channel is easy.

```typescript
// By name
let myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve({ name: "my-precise-tc" });
// Also by name
myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve("my-precise-tc");

console.log(myPreciseTC.key); // 1-1

// By key
myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve({ key: "1-1" });
// Also by key
myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve("1-1");
```

If the channel is not found or multiple channels match the query parameters, the client
will raise a `synnax.QueryError`.

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

Retrieving multiple channels is also simple. All of the following queries return the same channels.

```typescript
// By name
let channels = client.channels.retrieve({ names: ["sensor-one", "sensor-two"] });
// Also by name
channels = client.channels.retrieve("sensor-one", "sensor-two");

console.log(channels.map((c) => c.key)); // ["1-1", "2-12"]

// By key
channels = client.channels.retrieve({ keys: ["1-1", "2-12"] });
// By key and name
channels = client.channels.retrieve({ names: ["sensor-one"], keys: ["2-12"] });
```

Unlike retrieving a single channel, retrieving several channels will not raise a query
error when no or multiple channels are found for a given parameter. If no results match,
the method will return an empty list. Sometimes its useful to know which channel’s weren’t
found. To receive a list of parameters without a matching channel, set the `includeNotFound`
argument to `true`.

```typescript
const [channels, notFound] = client.channels.retrieve({
    names: ["sensor-one", "sensor-three", "does-not-exist"],
    includeNotFound: true,
});

console.log(channels.length); // 2
console.log(notFound); // ["does-not-exist"]
```
