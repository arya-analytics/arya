Named ranges identify specific periods time with a label. Read and write telemetry data 
to these ranges and attach meta-data to them. 


## Creating a Named Range


Creating a named range is as easy as calling `client.ranges.create`:

<ClientTabs includeSetup={false}>


<Fragment slot="python">

```python
from datetime import datetime

my_named_range = client.ranges.create(
    # This name does not need to be unique, but it's a good idea to
    # pick something that will be easy to identify later.
    name="My Named Range",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 12:30:00")
        end = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 14:30:00")
    ),
)
```
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="typescript">

```ts
const start = new Date("2023-2-12 12:30:00");
const end = new Date("2023-2-12 14:30:00");

const myNamedRange = await client.ranges.create({
    // This name does not need to be unique, but it's a good idea to
    // pick something that will be easy to identify later.
    name: "My Named Range",
    timeRange: { start, end },
});
```
</Fragment>

</ClientTabs>

## Retrieving a Named Range

You can retrieve a named range by it's name or key.

<ClientTabs includeSetup={false}>
<Fragment slot="python">

```python
# By name
my_named_range = client.ranges.retrieve("My Named Range")

# By key
my_named_range = client.ranges.retrieve(my_named_range.key)
```

Or retrieve multiple ranges at once:

```python
# By name
my_named_ranges = client.ranges.retrieve([
    "My Named Range", 
    "My Other Named Range",
])

# By key
my_named_ranges = client.ranges.retrieve([
    my_named_range.key, 
    my_other_named_range.key,
])
```
</Fragment>


<Fragment slot="typescript">

```ts
# By name
const myNamedRange = await client.ranges.retrieve("My Named Range");
# By key
const myNamedRange = await client.ranges.retrieve(myNamedRange.key);
```
</Fragment>
</ClientTabs>


## Searching for Ranges

<ClientTabs includeSetup={false}>
<Fragment slot="python">
If you don't know the exact name of the range you're looking for, you can perform
fuzzy search to find it.

```python
range_one = client.ranges.create(
    name="My Named Range 1", 
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start=datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 12, 12, 30, 0), 
        end=datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 12, 14, 30, 0),
    ),
)

range_two = client.ranges.create(
    name="My Named Range 2", 
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start=datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 13, 12, 50, 0), 
        end=datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 12, 14, 55, 0),
    ),
)

results = client.ranges.search("My Named Range")
print([r.name for r in results])

# ["My Named Range 1", "My Named Range 2"]
```
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="typescript">

```ts
const start = new Date("2023-2-12 12:30:00");
const end = new Date("2023-2-12 14:30:00");

const rangeOne = await client.ranges.create({
    name: "My Named Range 1",
    timeRange: { start, end },
});

const start = new Date("2023-2-13 12:50:00");
const end = new Date("2023-2-13 14:55:00");

const rangeTwo = await client.ranges.create({
    name: "My Named Range 2",
    timeRange: { start, end },
});

const results = await client.ranges.search("My Named Range");

console.log(results.map((r) => r.name));
// ["My Named Range 1", "My Named Range 2"]
```
</Fragment>
