import ClientTabs from "@/components/ClientTabs/ClientTabs.astro";

Synnax supports several different ways of reading from a cluster: by pure time range, 
by retrieving a named range and accessing it's data, or by leveraging a server side 
iterator for large reads. This page will cover all three methods and when to use each.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you’ve already:

1.   [Started a cluster](/deploy/get-started)
2.  [Familiarized yourself with channels](/concepts/channels)
3.  [Installed the Synnax client in the language of your choice](/analyze/get-started)

## Read Directly from a Channel

### Single Channel Read

Reading from a single channel is easy. Simply retrieve the channel and provide a time
range to the `read` method on the client.

```python
from datetime import datetime

channel = client.channels.retrieve("my-precise-tc")

start = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 12:30:00")
end = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 14:30:00")

data, tr = channel.read(start, end)
```

This method returns a numpy `ndarray` containing all data occupying the queried time range.
The second return value is a `TimeRange` object that provides the timestamp of the first
sample in the data and the timestamp of the last sample in the data. This is
particularly useful when the channel contains data for only part of the time range,
and you're interested in the exact time range of the

### Multi-Channel Read

Reading from multiple channels is just as easy.

```python
df = client.read_frame(
    start,
    end,
    ["my-precise-tc", "time"]
).as_df()
```

### Single Channel Read

Reading from a channel is easy. Simply retrieve the channel and provide a time range to
the `read` method on the client:

```typescript
const channel = client.channels.retrieve("my-precise-tc");

const start = new Date("2023-2-12 12:30:00");
const end = new Date("2023-2-12 14:30:00");

const [data, tr] = channel.read(start, end);
```

### Multi-Channel Read

Reading from multiple channels is just as easy.

```typescript
const frame = client.read_frame(start, end, "my-precise-tc", "time");

const tcData = frame.retrieve("my-precise-tc");
const timeData = frame.retrieve("time");
```

## Use an Iterator for Large Reads


<ClientTabs includeSetup={false}>
<Fragment slot="python">

Single and multi-channel reads will cover must of your needs, but in some cases, it's
necessary to process quantities of data that can’t fit in memory. This is where iterators
come into play. An iterator can efficiently traverse a time range with hundreds of billions
of samples. You can read conceptually about iterators here.

We can create a new iterator by providing the channels we want to read along with a time
range. The following code creates an iterator that will read 100 samples at a time
and reads each frame.

```python
with client.new_iterator(start, end, "my-precise-tc", "time", chunk_size=100) as i:
    for frame in iter:
        # Do something with the current frame
```

We recommend using the iterator as a context manager. This ensures that all iterator-related
resources are freed if an exception is thrown or the context exits.

    chunkSize: 100,
});
```

This opens an iterator configured to read 100 samples at a time. We can iterate through
each frame of samples easily.

```typescript
try {
    if (!iter.seekFirst()) {
        console.log("Iterator has no data!");
        return;
    }
    while (iter.next()) {
        const frame = iter.value();
        // Do something with the current frame.
    }
} finally {
    iter.close();
}
```

It’s important to close an iterator after you’re done with it, so we reccommend wrapping
it’s usage in a try-except clause with a call to `close` in the finally block.
