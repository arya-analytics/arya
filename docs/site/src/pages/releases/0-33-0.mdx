We've added a new [log component](/reference/console/logs) to the Synnax
[Console](/reference/console/get-started) that allows you to view channel data in a log
format. This component can be connected to any channel, and is particularly useful for
tracking the progress of [control sequences](/reference/control/get-started) and other
automated hardware control processes.
