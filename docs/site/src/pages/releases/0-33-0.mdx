### Summary

Synnax version 0.33 brings two highly requested features: LabJack support and a new Log
component within the Synnax Console.

We've also made a number of performance improvements and bug fixes.

### LabJack Support

LabJack T-Series devices are now fully supported using our built-in [LabJack driver](/reference/device-drivers/labjack).
You can use a write task to control digital and analog outputs on the device, and acquire
data from inputs using a read task.

We currently only support LabJack devices on Windows, but expect to add support for other
platforms soon.

### Breaking Changes

This release does **not** introduce any breaking changes.
