Synnax beta version 33 introduces two highly requested features: Full support for
LabJack devices and a new log component.

We've also made a number of performance improvements and bug fixes.

### LabJack Support

All LabJack T-Series devices are fully supported using our built-in [LabJack driver](/reference/device-drivers/labjack).
You can use a [write task](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/write-task) to control
digital and analog outputs on the device, and a [read task](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/read-task) to acquire
data from inputs.

Synnax currently only support LabJack devices on Windows, although we plan to add support
for other platforms soon.

### Log Component

We've added a new [log component](/reference/console/logs) to the Synnax [Console](/reference/console/get-started)
that allows you to view channel data in a log format. This component can be connected
to any channel, and is particularly useful for tracking the progress of [control sequences](/reference/control/get-started)
and other automated hardware control processes.

### Breaking Changes

This release does **not** introduce any breaking changes.
