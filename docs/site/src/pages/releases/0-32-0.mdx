Synnax version 32 makes an improvement to [National Instruments Analog Read tasks](/reference/device-drivers/ni/analog-read-task).
The new version allows you to specify acquire data from multiple devices in a single task. This is useful in one of two scenarios:

1. You have multiple devices and you want to acquire data from all of them synchronously.
2. You have many different cards on a single chassis (e.g. cDAQ-9174) and you need to avoid hitting the maximum number of allowed tasks.
