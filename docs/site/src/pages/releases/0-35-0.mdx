<Release
    version="0.35.0"
    date="Nov 25, 2024"
    title="Table Component"
>

Synnax version 0.35.0 introduces the table component. 

You can use the table component to display data in a tabular format and can be configured to highlight specific cells based on their values.
A suitable use case for the table component is to display data that should be flagged for exceeding certain thresholds and to provide a visual state representation of the data.

Synnax currently only supports LabJack devices on Windows, although we plan to add
support for other operating systems soon.

### New Schematic Symbols

This release also introduces 8 new schematic symbols.

### Other Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Reduced response times for configuring [LabJack](/reference/device-drivers/labjack) tasks.
- Enable support for multiple [OPC UA read tasks](/reference/device-drivers/opc-ua/read-task) on a single OPC UA Server
- Improved shutdown procedure for the Synnax server and embedded driver.
- The light schematic symbol can now accept telemetry types beyond just boolean sources, and includes a threshold setting to trigger state changes

### Breaking Changes

This release does **not** introduce any breaking changes.
