## What is Synnax?

Synnax is a platform for acquiring, controlling, and analyzing data from hardware
systems. Synnax delivers:

-   High-performance, horizontally scalable storage for sensor & actuator data.
-   Millisecond-latency data streaming.
-   First-class exploratory and automated analysis using industry standard tools.
-   User interfaces for visualization, instrumentation management, and manual control.
-   A control sequence system for automating complex control and analysis tasks.

Whether you are part of a large team with tens of thousands of sensors and actuators or
an individual working on a personal project, Synnax can help you develop and deploy your
hardware faster.

## How to Use These Docs

The Synnax documentation is divided into two categories. The [guides](#guides) contain
workflow oriented guides for specific users, such as test engineers or analysts, while
the [references](#references) are oriented around the main components of the platform.

The navigation bar on the left contains a link to every page in the documentation. Use
the tabs at the top to switch between the reference and guide focused browsing. Feel
free to use the search bar at the top of the page to find specific topics.
