## What is Synnax?

Synnax is a platform for acquiring, controlling, and analyzing data from hardware 
systems. It delivers:

* Fast, distributed telemetry storage and streaming
* First-class exploratory and automated analysis using industry standard tools
* A performant framework for manual and programatic control

## How to Use These Docs

This documentation is divided into two categories. The first is a set of workflow oriented
guides that walk you through using Synnax to accomplish a task. 

The second is a set of references that document specific features of the platform. If 
you're new to Synnax, we recommend starting with our guides, and using the references
to answer targeted questions as they arise.

### Navigation
