This walks you through deploying a single node cluster for production use, which requires
a few additional steps compared to development use.

## Security - Configuring TLS

We recommend using TLS for securing all communications with your cluster. In fact, TLS
is required for connecting to a remote cluster with the [Synnax Console](/console/get-started).

There are four important command line options for configuring TLS:

1. `--certs-dir` - The path to a directory containing the necessary certificates for the
cluster to use.
2. `--ca-cert` - The path relative to `--certs-dir` to the certificate authority (CA) 
certificate. This is only required if you're using a self-signed certificate. Certificates
generated by public CA's like Let's Encrypt are already trusted, so you don't need to
specify this option.
3. `--node-cert` - The path relative to `--certs-dir` to the node's public certificate file. 
4. `--node-key` - The path relative to `--certs-dir` to the node's private key file.
