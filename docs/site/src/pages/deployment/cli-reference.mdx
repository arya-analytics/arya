## Start 

The `start` command starts a node in a Synnax cluster, bootstrapping a new cluster if
necessary.

### Examples

#### Starting a single-node cluster

We can use the `i` and `m` flags to start a single node in insecure mode with an 
in-memory data store.

```cmd
synnax start -l localhost:9090 -im
```

#### Joining a node to an existing cluster

We can use the `p` flag to join a node to an existing cluster. If the node has no 
existing cluster data, it will attempt to join the cluster by repeatedly contacting
each peer in the list until successful.

```cmd
synnax start -l localhost:9090 -p localhost:9091,localhost:9092
```
