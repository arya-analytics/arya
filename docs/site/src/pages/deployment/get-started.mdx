This page will walk you through starting a single node cluster for testing, learning, or
development. To get started, select your operating system below.

## Using Docker

The simplest way to start a single node cluster is by using the `synnaxlabs/synnax` Docker image,
simply run:

```cmd
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a single node 
cluster with the following parameters:

`-p 9090:9090` - This maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container. This allows
access to the Synnax node from the host machine.

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

Starting the node will also provision a root user with the username `synnax` and the 
password `seldon`.

For detailed documentation on the `start` command, see the [CLI Reference](/deployment/cli-reference).

## Using Linux

To start a single node cluster on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux" />

Then, move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```cmd
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<div class="info">
<b>Note - </b> You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment
variable. You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</div>

Finally, start the node:

```cmd
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

Starting the node will also provision a root user with the username `synnax` and the 
password `seldon`.

For detailed documentation on the `start` command, see the [CLI Reference](/deployment/cli-reference).

## Using MacOS

To start a single node cluster on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos" />

Next, move the binary to `usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

Then, give execution permissions to the binary:

```cmd
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<div class="info">
<b>Note - </b> You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment
variable. You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</div>

Finally, start the node:

```cmd
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

Starting the node will also provision a root user with the username `synnax` and the 
password `seldon`.

## Using Windows

Unfortunately, Synnax does not support Windows yet. If you are interested in running Synnax on
Windows, let us know here. For now, we recommend using Docker or WSL along with the
instructions for Linux.
