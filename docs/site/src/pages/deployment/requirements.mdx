This page lists the hardware and software requirements for deploying a Synnax cluster.

### Operating System

A Synnax node can run on Linux, MacOS, or any containerized environment. We currently
do not support Windows. If you'd like to run Synnax on Windows, please let us know
[here](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/issues/233).

### Networking

Nodes gossip with each other at regular intervals to share information about cluster
state and health. They also communicate with each other to read and write data to the
cluster. To support this, Synnax requires that every node can reach **all** other nodes in the
cluster.

### Hardware

Node hardware requirements vary depending on the workload you are running. The following
table provides bare minimum requirements for testing as well as a recommended minimum
configuration for production.
