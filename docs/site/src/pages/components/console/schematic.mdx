## PID Overview

The piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) view is used to see a diagram of
your test setup which will read live values. It also allows the user to exercise
control over various channels in the system in order to manually run a test or
operation.

An example PID from a simulated DAQ is shown below:

<Image client:only="react" id="roles/operations/pid/pid"  />

There are three modes that the PID viewer can be in: edit mode, neutral mode,
and control mode. These modes can be switched between by hovering over the
toolbar in the bottom left of the window. In edit mode, the PID elements can be
moved to arrange the display. In neutral mode, nothing happens while live
telemetry comes in. In control mode, the user can activate elements on the PID
viewer to affect the system state.

## Symbols
The heart of the PID view is symbols. These symbols are a visual representation
of sensors, actuators, and anything else on a test system. If the symbols are
not appearing on the bottom of the screen, make sure to tap the visualization
icon in the bottom right. Synnax has a collection of built-in symbols, such as
valves, values, and buttons. To place a symbol, drag and drop onto the screen.
The properties of symbols are detailed below.

### Style
The style tab on a symbol allows users to edit the symbols label, size,
orientation, color, and other various visual properties. A value's units can
also be edited here. To edit this, click on a PID element on the diagram and
then click the "Properties" tab in the bottom right.

### Telemetry
The "Telemetry" tab is a property of the value element, and is for elements that
strictly receive data.
- "Input Channel" selects which channel data is being read from.
- "Precision" determines what precision values will appear on the GUI. A
  precision number of 2 means that 2 decimal places will be seen.
- "Averaging Window" determines how many samples are averaged together to appear
  on the screen. If the value 2 is selected, the value displayed on screen will
  be the average of the last 2 values.

### Control
The "Control" tab is a property of any element that takes inputs and outputs. An
example of this is a switch.
- "Input Channel" is the channel that PID viewer reads from. For instance,
  acknowledgement channels are often used as the input channels.
- "Output Channel" is a write channel that Synnax writes to. This are often
  write channels on a DAQ. When you click on the PID element to actuate it, this
  channel is the one that gets changed.

### Connection lines
Every element has spots for connection lines / tubes. When hovering over an
element, places for these connections appear. You can then drag this line to
another element to draw a connection line on the PID viewer.

First, we can make a diagram off of the provided symbols such as valves, tanks,
and values. Just drag and drop to make what you want!

Here, I have added two tanks, each with a value attached (for the pressure), and
also added a valve in between them. Most elements of the PID have nodes that you
can draw lines between.

After clicking an element, there are two options, “style” and “control”. Under
“Style”, there are options for changing the label, the label size, the color,
and the orientation for all elements. The orientation buttons allow you to
change the direction of the symbol or the location of the name. The label

## Control mode
In control mode, elements on the PID are able to be activated for manual control
of the system. Clicking on an actionable element, such as a valve, switch, or
button, allows you to activate the output channel on that element. The circle on
the element shows what is in control. If the circle is blue, the current PID
view has control. If the circle is green, the current PID view has absolute
control. If the circle is red, the current PID view does not have control as the
element is part of an automated sequence or controlled by another PID view.

The color of the bar indicates what is controlling the elements on the PID.
There is a legend on the display indicating what controlling node is what color.
