## UI Overview
An image of the Synnax console is shown below.

<Image client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview/ui-main-view"/>

<>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <Text.Text level="p">
        <Icon.Resources /> __Resources__ are located on the left-hand side of the
        </Text.Text>
    </li>
  </ul>
</>

The folder on the left side is the file tree of the resources that the Synnax
  console uses. Click on the folder to open the file tree.


- Your workspaces are listed as tabs along the top.
- The + button in the top right allows you to add another visualization to your
  current workspace.
- The clock on the right allows you to create a new range to save a specific
  time range.
- The graph on the bottom right allows you to open up properties of the current
  visualization that you are working on.


## Workspaces
Next, you will be prompted to create a workspace. A workspace is a collection of
visualizations, either line plots or P&ID diagrams. You can save visualizations
as part of a workspace so all members of the cluster can view a certain
workspace. To switch between workspaces, you can choose a different workspace in
the resources tree or click on a different workspace in the top left. The
workspace we will be working with is called "Test Workspace"

## Resources File Tree

An exploded view of the resources file tree is shown below:

<Image client:only="react" id="roles/operations/installation/resources-tree"  />


In the resources tab on the top left, there are several folders.
- __Channels__ are the sensor channels that you can track and plot.
- __Clusters__ is the list of all nodes currently connected to the cluster.
- __Labels__ are not currently implemented in Synnax.
- __Racks__ are not currently implemented in Synnax.
- __Ranges__ are saved times that you can use when loading data to view. For
  instance, you can save the time of a test as a range with name Test 1, and
  then load that range on the line plot view when looking at data.
- __Users__ are a list of all users logged into the cluster. The workspaces
  created by the users can be found underneath their name.
- __Workspaces__ list all created workspaces in the cluster. This tree includes
  workspaces created by all users.


## Visualizations

To visualize data in your workspace, there are two main types of visualizations.
The first is called a "Line Plot", and is a line graph that allows you to plot
line charts together. The second type of view is called a "PID view". This view,
which stands for piping and instrumentation diagram, allows you to make a
schematic of your system with live values that pop up on it. More information
about using the line plot is covered [here](/roles/operations/line-plot), and
information about the PID view is covered [here](/roles/operations/pid).

## Ranges

When you create a range, the following box is shown:

<Image client:only="react" id="roles/operations/installation/create-range"  />

Choose a name for the range and the start and end times. The start and end times
will be the local time of your machine. If you want the range to be viewable by
others in your cluster, click "Save to Synnax". If you want the range to be
viewable only by yourself, click "Save locally".
