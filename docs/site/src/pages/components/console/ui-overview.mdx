## UI Overview
An image of the Synnax console is shown below.

<Image client:only="react" id="console/ui-main-view"/>

<Text.Text level="p">
  <ul>
    <li><Icon.Resources/> __Resources__ are located on the left-hand side of the screen and show the file tree used for Synnax data.</li>
    <li><Icon.Workspace/> __Workspaces__ are located on the top of the file screen.</li>
    <li>__Visualizations__ are listed as tabs on the top of the screen. In the view above, the only visualization is the "Get Started" visualization.
        You can add more visualizations by clicking on the <Icon.Add /> button in the top right.</li>
    <li>In the top right, there are buttons for <Icon.QuestionMark/> opening documentation, <Icon.Subtract/> minimizing the window,
        <Icon.Box/> maximizing the window, and <Icon.Close/> closing the window.</li>
    <li><Icon.Range/> __Ranges__ are specific time periods determined by users where important events happened. To learn more about ranges, you can read the
        reference page on [querying ranges](/console/querying-data).</li>
    <li><Icon.Visualize/> __Visualizations__ have properties that are accessed by clicking on the icon in the bottom right.</li>
    <li><Icon.Cluster/> The current __cluster__ is shown in the bottom right, along with whether the console is connected or disconnected to the cluster.</li>
    <li>The current version of the Synnax console is shown in the bottom right.</li>
  </ul>

## Workspaces
Next, you will be prompted to create a workspace. A workspace is a collection of
visualizations, either line plots or schematic diagrams. You can save visualizations
as part of a workspace so all members of the cluster can view a certain
workspace. To switch between workspaces, you can choose a different workspace in
the resources tree or click on a different workspace in the top left.

## Resources File Tree

An exploded view of the resources file tree is shown below:

<Image client:only="react" id="roles/operations/installation/resources-tree"  />


In the resources tab on the top left, there are several folders:
- __Channels__ are the sensor channels that you can track and plot.
- __Clusters__ is the list of all nodes currently connected to the cluster, and
  which channels are leased to each node.
- __Labels__ are not currently implemented in Synnax.
- __Racks__ are not currently implemented in Synnax.
- __Ranges__ are saved times that you can use when loading data to view. For
  instance, you can save the time of a test as a range with name Test 1, and
  then load that range on the line plot view when looking at data.
- __Users__ are a list of all users logged into the cluster. The workspaces
  created by the users can be found underneath their name.
- __Workspaces__ list all created workspaces in the cluster. This tree includes
  workspaces created by all users.


## Visualizations

To visualize data in your workspace, there are two main types of visualizations.
The first is called a "Line Plot", and is a line graph that allows you to plot
line charts together. The second type of view is called a "Schematic". This view
allows you to make a schematic of your system with live values that pop up on
it. More information about using the line plot is covered
[here](line-plot), and information about the schematic view is
covered [here](schematic).
