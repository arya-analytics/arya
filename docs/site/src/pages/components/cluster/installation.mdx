This page will walk you through how to install the Synnax binary on Windows, MacOS, and
Linux. To get started, select your operating system below:

## Installing on Linux

To install Synnax on a Linux distribution, run the following command to download the latest
binary:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux"  />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our users
use `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running the following

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one liner for your shell:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Or, for `zsh`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If any previous versions of Synnax are installed and available on your `PATH`, you
may need to remove them to avoid conflicts.

<Note variant="warning">
If you've also installed the [Synnax Python Client](/components/python-client/get-started),
its `synnax` command may take precedence over the one you just installed. To avoid conflicts,
rename the binary you've just installed to something else, like `synnax-server` by running:

```
mv /usr/local/bin/synnax /usr/local/bin/synnax-server
```

Then, you can run the binary using `synnax-server` instead of `synnax`.
</Note>

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

You may need to use `sudo` to run the above command if you do not have the 
necessary permissions.

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
synnax --version
```

You should see the following output:

<SynnaxVersionOutput />

## Installing on MacOS

To install Synnax on MacOS, run the following command to download the latest binary:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos"  />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our users
use `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running the following

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one liner for your shell:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

To install Synnax on Windows, download the latest binary from the following link:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="windows" />

<Note variant="info">
<b>Note - </b> We recommend adding `;$env:appdata/synnax` to your `PATH` environment variable, which 
will allow you to execute synnax commands from any shell. See [Microsoft's Environment Variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.4#saving-changes-to-environment-variables)
documentation for more.

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```powershell
