Streaming telemetry is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and monitoring. 
This page guides you through using the Typescript client to stream telemetry from a 
Synnax cluster.

## Open a Streamer

To start streaming data, call the `open_streamer` method on the client and provide a 
list of channels to stream.

```python
streamer = client.open_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"])
```

## Reading Frames

Then, to read the next incoming telemetry frame, call the `read` method on the 
StorageManager.

```python
frame = streamer.read()
```

This call will block until a new frame is available. **This frame may not 
contain data for every channel specified**. For example, if we're reading from two sensors
that are being sampled by different devices at different rates, we may receive a frame
containing data only for the first channel, followed by a frame containing only data
for the second ChannelMergerNode.

### Using a For Loop

The streamer object is an iterator, so you can use it in a for loop to iterate over
incoming frames, blocking on each iteration until a new frame is received.

```python
for frame in streamer:
    print(frame)
```

## Closing the Streamer

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on the 
streamer to release the network connection and other related resources.

```python
streamer.close()
```

### Using a Context Manager

We recommend using the streamer as a context manager where possible, as this makes it easy
to ensure that the streamer is closed correctly.

```python
with client.open_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"]) as streamer:
    for frame in streamer:
        print(frame)
```

## Using an Async Streamer

If you're interested in using `asyncio` to stream telemetry, you can use the 
`open_async_streamer` method on the client. This streamer implements an identical interface
to a synchronous streamer, but all methods are asynchronous.

```python
async with await client.open_async_streamer(["channel1", "channel2"]) as streamer:
    async for frame in streamer:
        print(frame)
```
