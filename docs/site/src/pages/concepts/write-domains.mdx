This page walks you through the lifecycle of a write to a cluster, and how domains are
used as units of transaction control. If you're looking for a practical guide on writing
to a synnax cluster, look [here](/acquire/write-telemetry).

## What is a Domain?

Domains represent regions of continuously written samples in a Channel. Domains have a
time range whose start is the timestamp of the first sample in the domain, and the
end is the timestamp of the last sample.

## Transactions

Write transactions to a cluster allocate a new domain for each channel involved. Unlike
most databases, transactions in Synnax can last several hours and contain billions
of samples.

The transaction lifecycle is controlled by a writer. To begin a transaction, a caller
opens a new writer and then begins writing telemetry frames using a file like interface.
After they're done writing, the user commits the write to the database, making it available
for reading. Synnax transactions are unique in that they can be committed **multiple**
times, where each new commit extends the data written in the previous commit. After the
final commit, the user closes the writer, at which point the cluster releases all write
related resources and the domain can no longer be extended.

### Open Phase

To start a new transaction, a user must specify two properties:

1. The channels they wish to write to.
2. The timestamp marking the start of the new domain.

Using this information, the database validates the following:

1. That all channels exist in the database.
2. That no existing domain overlaps with the provided timestamp. If any domains overlap,
   the new domain is invalid and cannot be committed.
3. That all channels share the same rate or index. 

### Write Phase

After all validation checks pass, the transaction enters the write phase. During this
period, a user can write continuous frames of telemetry to the domain. These frames must
be vertical (i.e. all channels must have a single array specified), and all arrays must 
have the same number of samples. You can read more about frame alignment here.

These frames are assumed to be continuous by the database. To illustrate this, imagine
we write the following frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |

After this write, our domain looks exactly like our first frame. Then we write the
next frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |

Now, our domain looks like this:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.20         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |

Throughout the write phase, we can continue extending our domain by adding frames.

### Commit Phase

Once we're ready to persist the transaction and make it available for reads, we commit
our writer. During this phase, the cluster identifies the time range of the domain based
on the provided starting timestamp and the samples written, and then checks if it overlaps
with any existing domains for the channels being written to. If there is no overlap, the
commit process succeeds and the write is now available for reads. After this phase completes,
the transaction is moved back into the write phase. At this point, we can either write
more frames to the cluster and commit again, or we can close the writer.

### Close Phase

Once done writing, the user can close the writer and release all of it's resources. From
this point onward, the domain cannot be extended. Opening a new writer at the end timestamp
of the written domain will allocate a new domain instead. All uncomitted writes will be lost.
If the writer was never committed, the new domain will not be created.
