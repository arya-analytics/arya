Synnax is a distributed telemetry engine designed to acquire and store data from, issue
commands to, and process telemetry generated by hardware systems. It scales horizontally,
and can be deployed on edge devices for data acquisition or in cloud environments for
high-performance analysis.

Synnax inherits a hybrid pedigree from hardware data acquisition systems and cloud-native,
horizontally scalable databases. We’re focused on keeping the system simple, and these
pages will introduce you to the core concepts needed to work effectively with a Synnax cluster.

## Distribution Components

### Nodes

A [node](/concepts/clusters-and-nodes) is an individual, running instance of the Synnax executable. The host machine
can be an edge device, VM, container, or bare metal server. The only requirement is
that it can store data on disk and has an address reachable by other nodes in the cluster.

### Clusters

Nodes communicate with each other to form a [cluster](/concepts/clusters-and-nodes). The
nodes in a cluster collaborate to read, write, and exchange data. Nodes expose the cluster
as a monolothic data space, meaning that a user can query a single node for the entire
cluster’s telemetry without being aware of where it is actually stored.

## Telemetry Components

Now that we’ve covered the basic distributed systems terminology, we’re ready to step
into the telemetry components in a cluster.

To illustrate how these components work together, we’ll use the example of a cyclist
who takes several two-hour rides over the course of a month. During each ride, they
use a speedometer to record their instantaneous speed once per second.

### Samples

A sample is a strongly typed value recorded at a specific point in time. The readings
from our cyclicts’s speedometer are reported as `float32` values in kilometers per hour.

### Channels

A [channel](/concepts/channels) is a logical collection of samples emitted by or representing the values of a
single source. We can store the speedometer readings across all the cyclists’s rides in
a single channel titled “speed-gps”. We can also create channels that store post-processed
results or simulated values. For example, we can record target speeds for each ride in a
“speed-target” channel, and then write the difference between our target and actual
readings in a “speed-diff” channel. As long as the samples are time-ordered, do not
have duplicates (i.e. no two samples have the same timestamp), and have a consistent
data type, they can be contained in a channel.

### Domains

[Domains](/concepts/write-domains) are continuous, non-overlapping time-partitions of a channel’s data. When writing
to a channel, a user must first define the starting timestamp of a new domain. After
doing so, they are free to write chunks of telemetry. Once finished, they commit the
domain with an ending timestamp to atomically persist it to the channel. If the domain
overlaps with a previously written domain, the commit process fails.

We can allocate a new domain at the start of each ride, and then commit the domain once
finished. Over the course of three rides, we’ll create a domain for each ride and write
7200 samples to it. Our “speed-gps” channel will now contain 21600 samples.

### Ranges

A [range](/concepts/read-ranges) (short for "time range"), is a user defined region of a channel's data. Unlike
domains, ranges are purely for categorization and do not affect the structure of a channel's
data. Ranges can be subsections of a domain or span multiple domains. They can also overlap
with or contain other ranges. Ranges are typically used to indicate important events or
categorize large periods of time.

After each ride, we can identify periods of interest, such as hills or descents, and define
ranges to mark them as relevant for analysis. If our cyclist is training for a century race,
we can also wrap all of their rides in a ‘century training’ range to keep them nicely categorized.

### Arrays

While domains and ranges virtually separate areas of related data, arrays are used to hold
the actual samples. Arrays are strongly typed and hold their values in time-order. When
writing data to the cluster, a user must provide a frame (see below) containing an array
of samples for each channel they wish to write to. When reading data, they receive a frame
containining arrays of samples for each channel across the requested period of time.

Arrays also have a time range to specify the region of the channel's data they represent.
While a user does not need to specify a time range when writing data, all arrays read from
the cluster will have one specified.

### Frames

A frame is a collection of related arrays. These arrays
forrm a table like structure comparable to a pandas `DataFrame` in Python or a `data.frame`
in R. Each column holds a one or more arrays. They're the fundamental unit of data transfer
within a cluster, and are used for reads, writes, and internal replication.

## Synnax as a Spreadsheet

A Synnax cluster's data can be though of as a very large, distributed spreadsheet.
Each channel is a column and each row contains several samples.
