This page walks you through what channels are, their important properties, and how to use
them when structuring your cluster.

If you’re looking for a practical guide on creating or retrieving channels via the CLI,
UI, or client libraries, look here.

## What is a Channel?

A channel is a logical collection of samples emitted by or representing the values of a
single source. Practically, a channel holds sensor data such as speedometer, pressure
transducer, or memory usage readings. It can also hold post-processed results such as
the noise-filtered signal of another channel. The only restrictions are that samples in
a channel must be time-ordered and share the same data type.

## A Brief Primer on Domains

Channel data is stored in regions of continuously written samples called domains. A domain
is marked by a time range, where the starting point is the timestamp of the first sample
in the domain, and the ending point is the timestamp of the last sample.

Domains are used to identify and separate periods of continuous recording, and typically
correlate to different tests or experiments run over the course of several hours, weeks,
or years. It’s common for channels to have thousands or even millions of domains.

Domains are covered in detail [here](/concepts/write-domains), although this introduction 
should be enough for the subsequent sections.

## Channel Types

Synnax works with two broad categories of telemetry: regular and variable. Regular
telemetry is emitted by a source at consistently spaced intervals, such as 200Hz. Because
each domain in a channel stores its starting timestamp, we can easily calculate the timestamp
of the nth sample by virtue of the data’s rate. This means that the cluster can perform
fast lookups and avoid writing potentially billions of unneeded timestamps.

Variable telemetry arrives at fluctuating rates and is more challenging to work with.
To handle the inconsistent gaps between samples, the cluster stores the timestamp
associated with each sample, and then builds indexes around these timestamps in order to
perform efficient lookups.

To effectively work with these two categories of data, Synnax employs three types of channels:

1. Fixed Rate - Stores telemetry arriving at a consistent rate specified when creating the channel.
2. Variable Rate Indexed - Stores telemetry arriving at a variable rate. The samples in
   these channels are ‘indexed’ by a specified index channel.
3. Variable Rate Index - Stores the timestamps for samples in one or more indexed channels.
   The samples in these channels must be time-ordered, nanosecond integers. Timestamps in
   index channels are used to look up the samples in the channels ‘indexed’ by them.

### Fixed Rate

The simplest channel has a fixed rate, which assumes that its samples are spaced apart
at regular intervals (such as 10Hz or 25KHz). It’s best to use these types of channels
when data is arriving at a rate where the deviation in sample regularity is small enough
to be insignificant to your needs.

Fluctuations in the sampling rate of modern data acquisition devices are well within the
microsecond range. If you’re measuring the water level of a tank at 10Hz across several
hours, those microsecond deviations are probably insignificant to your analysis. In these
cases, it’s best to store samples in a fixed rate, 10Hz channel.

#### Gaps in Data

It’s unreasonable to assume that all the samples in a fixed rate channel will be regularly
spaced. In many cases, periods of continuous, regular recording are separated by long
periods of inactivity. This is where domains come into play. Two consecutive domains in
a fixed rate channel can be separated by several months. As long as the values recorded
within each domain are regularly spaced, the channel’s data is valid.

In theory, a fixed rate channel could consider every sample as its own, independent domain
where the start and end timestamps are the same. This is horribly inefficient, and, in
this case, you should use a variable rate, indexed channel instead. Fixed-rate channels
are only beneficial when periods of regular sampling contain at least two orders of
magnitude more samples than the number of domains in the channel. Practically, this
means that periods of regularity should contain at least several hundred samples if
not well into the thousands or millions.

#### Preserving Original Timestamp Data

In some cases, a sample rate is regular enough to warrant the benefits of a fixed rate
channel, but you’d still like to preserve the actual timestamps for scenarios where it
may be required. In this case, simply create another channel with the same sample rate
to hold the timestamps. You can then query the precise timestamps along with the channel’s
data as needed.

#### Avoiding Tolerance Stack Up

One of the main concerns our users have when working with fixed rate channels is
tolerance stack up. If a fixed-rate, 25Hz channel actually receives writes at a rate of
25.001Hz, after 2,000 samples, the calculated timestamp of the channel is 2 seconds 
earlier than its actual time of recording.

If you’re concerned about this, we recommend regularly separating long-lived writes into
multiple domains. Each domain will mark the accurate start timestamp of its first sample,
accounting for any issues with tolerance stack-up.

### Variable Rate - Index and Indexed Channels

If your data is sampled at a variable rate, you’ll need to use an index-indexed channel
pair. An index channel (or just “index”) is a special type of channel optimized for fast
lookups on timestamps. The values in an indexed channel must be time-ordered, `int64`
nanosecond UTC timestamps. Synnax provides utilities for converting between timestamp
formats and timezones.

Indexed channels are ‘indexed’ by the values in an index channel, which means that each
sample in the indexed channel has a correlated timestamp in its index. Multiple indexed
channels can have the same channel as their index. By efficiently finding the location
of the timestamp, Synnax can also quickly retrieve the associated samples.

Index channels play a similar role to primary keys in relational databases. The primary
key (in Synnax’s case, a timestamp) can be used to fetch related values in one or more
columns quickly.

#### Index Channels are Expensive

Efficiently doing point and range lookups on hundreds of millions or billions of samples
requires maintaining expensive data structures and executing many disk operations. When
possible, try to share the same index channel between many indexed channels. In a data
acquisition scenario, this typically means generating timestamps for each DAQ and using
them as the index for all other channels/sensors plugged into the device.

If you find that your use case requires many different channels that all sample at
different rates, Synnax might not be the right solution for you.

## Channel Fields

### Key

A channel’s key is auto-assigned by the cluster and is guaranteed to be unique.

### Name

A human-readable name for the channel. Synnax does not prevent duplicate names, but
we highly reccomend that you keep them unique.

### Data Type

The data type of the samples stored in the channel. A channel’s data type must have
a fixed **density** i.e. the number of bytes per sample is constant. Synnax has a number
of built in data types:

| Data Type   | Description                   | Density |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `bool`      | Boolean value                 | 1 byte  |
| `int8`      | Signed 8-bit integer          | 1 byte  |
| `int16`     | Signed 16-bit integer         | 2 bytes |
| `int32`     | Signed 32-bit integer         | 4 bytes |
| `int64`     | Signed 64-bit integer         | 8 bytes |
| `uint8`     | Unsigned 8-bit integer        | 1 byte  |
| `uint16`    | Unsigned 16-bit integer       | 2 bytes |
| `uint32`    | Unsigned 32-bit integer       | 4 bytes |
| `uint64`    | Unsigned 64-bit integer       | 8 bytes |
| `timestamp` | 64-bit nanosecond UTC integer | 8 bytes |
| `float32`   | 32-bit floating point         | 4 bytes |
| `float64`   | 64-bit floating point         | 8 bytes |

We’re also planning on adding support for custom data types such as fixed-size JSON
objects and arrays. If this is something that interests you, let us know.

### Is Index

If this value is true, the channel is considered an index channel. Index channels must
have a data type of `timestamp`, meaning that they must contain ordered `int64` nanosecond
UTC timestamps.

### Index

If the channel has a variable rate, this should be set to the key of the channel’s index.
If this parameter is provided, the channel is considered an indexed channel. This field
will be ignored for index channels, as they cannot be indexed.

### Rate

If the channel is not an index and an index has not been specified, the channel is
considered fixed rate. In this case, this field sets the sample rate at which values will
be written to domains in the channel. On the other hand, if the channel is an index or is
indexed, this parameter can be set to a rough approximation of the sample rate, which the
database will use for query optimization.
