In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of acquiring data from National 
Instruments (NI) devices using Synnax. We'll be collecting [thermocouple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple) data from a 
[cDAQ-9174](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/model/cdaq-9174.html?srsltid=AfmBOooEhdxpDWlxV68OV_4slLcRfi6s_5eiUkntifNNbOK8Gz1hjdMU), 
although this process can be universally applied to any NI device and channel type.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Installing NI DAQmx Drivers</StepText>

Our first step is to install the NI DAQmx driver. Synnax uses DAQmx to communicate with
your NI card. It's important to note that Synnax only supports the Windows version of
this driver, and won't work on MacOS or Linux.

Installation instructions are available [here](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html). 
These instructions will also guide you through installing [NI MAX](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-max.html),
which is a useful tool for configuring and testing your NI devices. NI MAX also let's you 
simulate a device (such as the one we're using in this guide) if you don't have one on hand.

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}>Installing Synnax</StepText>

Next, we'll need to install the latest version of the Synnax Console. Here's a handy
download button to get you started.

  <SynnaxConsoleDownloadButton client:load />
</Align.Space>

Once the download is complete, simply click on the installer and follow the instructions
to install Synnax on your machine.

When you start the console, you'll see a screen like this:

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}>Connecting your NI Device</StepText>

Now that you have both the DAQmx driver and Synnax installed, it's time to connect your 
NI device.
