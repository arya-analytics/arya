One of the most powerful tools Synnax has to offer is the ability to easily
write automated control sequences in Python. These control sequences can be run
from a command line to run both simple and complex sequences.

In the autosequence, make sure to import the library synnax into your script.
Major functions in the synnax library are described below.

## A note on write authorities
To determine what instance of Synnax should or shouldn't be controlling writes
to the system, the authority must be evaluated. Every instance of Synnax,
whether a 

`synnax.Synnax()`
This class is the major workhorse for the autosequence, and is how we
communicate for reading channels and writing to channels. The initialization
parameters for this class are the same credentials that you would use to log
into a server. An example initialization of this class is shown below:

```python
client = synnax.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
    secure=False,
)
```

More autosequence examples are listed in the Synnax code in the folder
`synnax\client\py\examples`.
