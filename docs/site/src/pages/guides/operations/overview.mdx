## What is Synnax?
Synnax is a sensor-data platform that allows data storage, processing, analysis,
viewing, and automated control. What that means is that Synnax can connect to
hardware systems, collect data, and allow users to both plot the data and run
automated control with the data.

## How does Synnax work?
The most important thing to know about Synnax how Synnax works is that it
consists of two main parts, nodes and clusters. _Nodes_ are an individual
instance of Synnax running - think of an individual computer running the Synnax
console, or an individual instance of an automated control server. Nodes that
are connected to each other form a _cluster_. Every node in the cluster has
access to the same data, and is able to save shared views such as line graphs or
Schematic views.

## Okay, but how does it really work?
Letâ€™s say that we have one cluster in Synnax for a jet engine test team. One
node of the cluster could be the DAQ hardware that connects to all of the
sensors and actuators, along with the computer controlling it. Another node
could be a computer running Synnax that the test operators use to view data from
the test. A third node could be some advanced analysis written by a design
engineer. All three of these nodes have access to the exact same data within
milliseconds. What this means is that the design engineer can run the analysis
while the test is ongoing or immediately after it finishes, the test engineers
can have their pretty plots saved to be looked at whenever, and the computer
running control can make control decisions based off the sensor data.
