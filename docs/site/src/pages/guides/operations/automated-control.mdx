One of the most powerful tools Synnax has to offer is the ability to easily write
control sequences in Python. These control sequences can be run from a command line to
run both simple and complex sequences.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites

Before writing a control sequence, you should have done the following:

-   Downloaded the [Python client](/reference/python-client/get-started)
-   Downloaded the [Synnax server](/reference/cluster/quick-start)
-   Downloaded the [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started)

### Running a Simulated DAQ

For the purpose of this guide, we will use a simulated DAQ to represent the hardware.
You can view the
[code](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/blob/main/client/py/examples/control/press/simulated_daq.py)
for this DAQ on Synnax's GitHub repository. This DAQ simulates a pressure vessel that
can be filled and vented using several valves. The DAQ has the following sensors and
actuators:

-   `daq_time`: represents the current timestamps for the DAQ. This is an index channels
    for the sensors on the DAQ.
-   `sensor_#`: Represents the current pressure in the pressure vessel. `sensor_0` will
    be the most important sensor for this guide.
-   `valve_command_#`: Represents the channel used to write data (open/close) the valve.
-   `valve_response_#`: Represents the channel used to read data from the valve (see if
    the valve is open or closed).
-   `valve_command_time_#`: The index channels used for commanding the valves. Valves
    need separate index channels than sensors in case the valves are commanded at
    different times.
-   `valve_0` will be used for filling the tank, and `valve_1` will be used for venting
    the tank.

## Writing the Control Sequence

At the top of your script, make sure to import the synnax library:

```python
import synnax as sy
```

The next step is to connect to a Synnax Cluster. This can be done by logging in with
through the [CLI](/reference/python-client/get-started#the-synnax-login-command) or by
[passing the
credentials](/reference/python-client/get-started#passing-credentials-directly) into
your script.

After that, we will want to make a `Synnax` object. This object is how we will interact
with the cluster:

```python
client = sy.Synnax()
```

We are also going to grab some channel names to use in our control sequence. These names
come from the simulated DAQ.

```python
PRESS_VALVE = "valve_command_0"
VENT_VALVE = "valve_command_1"
PRESSURE = "sensor_0"
```

Next, you'll need to open up a controller in Python. The controller is how values are
recorded in Synnax. We recommend using a context manager to ensure that the controller
is properly closed when the script is done.

```python
with client.control.acquire(
    name="Pressurization Sequence",
    write_authorities=[200],
    write=[PRESS_VALVE, VENT_VALVE],
    read=[PRESSURE],
) as controller:
```

<Note variant="info">

    Write authorities determine which instance of Synnax is allowed to write to
    hardware. Every writer in Synnax has an authority between 0 and 255. If two writers
    are open on the same channel, the writer with the higher authority will be able to
    write but the other one will not.

</Note>

Next, lets grab the start timestamp from the control sequence and set a target pressure:

```python
start = sy.TimeStamp.now()

target_pressure = 20 # psi
```

We should also make sure the vent valve is closed by calling the controller:

```python
controller[VENT_VALVE] = False
```

Finally, we can open the pressurization valve and wait to reach the target pressure
before closing the valve. This will require us to use the `wait_until` method on the
controller. The `wait_until` method will wait until the first argument is met or a
certain time has elapsed:

```python
controller[PRESS_VALVE] = True
controller.wait_until(
    lambda c: c[PRESSURE] > target_pressure,
    timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
)
controller[PRESS_VALVE] = False
```

<Note variant="info">
    Lambda functions are short, annonymous functions in Python. This lambda function can
    be equivalent to writing a function like this:

    ```python
    def if_pressure_reached(controller):
        return controller[PRESSURE] > target_pressure
    ```

    and then calling it in our code like this:

    ```python
    controller.wait_until(if_pressure_reached, timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second)
    ```

    For more information on lambda functions, you can visit our [reference
    page](/reference/control/sequence-basics#lambda-expressions) on controllers.

</Note>

We can then depressurize the tank by opening the vent valve:

```python
controller[VENT_VALVE] = True
controller.wait_until(
    lambda c: c[PRESSURE] < 5,
    timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
)
controller[VENT_VALVE] = False
```

After this, we can grab a range from the test. This range can give us easy access to the
test data when looking back later.

```python
client.ranges.create(
    name="Pressurization Test",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(start=start, end=sy.TimeStamp.now()),
)
```

This range is now saved and can be referenced later to view this test.

The full file, which I called `control_sequence.py` can be viewed below:

```python
import synnax as sy
import time

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="localhost",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
    secure=False,
)

PRESS_VALVE = "valve_command_0"
VENT_VALVE = "valve_command_1"
PRESSURE = "sensor_0"

with client.control.acquire(
    name="Pressurization Sequence",
    write_authorities=[200],
    write=[PRESS_VALVE, VENT_VALVE],
    read=[PRESSURE],
) as controller:
    start = sy.TimeStamp.now()

    target_pressure = 20 # psi

    controller[VENT_VALVE] = False

    controller[PRESS_VALVE] = True
    controller.wait_until(
        lambda c: c[PRESSURE] > target_pressure,
        timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
    )
    controller[PRESS_VALVE] = False

    time.sleep(3)

    controller[VENT_VALVE] = True
    controller.wait_until(
        lambda c: c[PRESSURE] < 5,
        timeout = 20 * sy.TimeSpan.Second,
    )
    controller[VENT_VALVE] = False

    client.ranges.create(
        name="Pressurization Test",
        time_range=sy.TimeRange(start=start, end=sy.TimeStamp.now()),
    )
```

## Running and Viewing Control Sequence

The first step to running the control sequence is to start a [local Synnax
cluster](/reference/cluster/quick-start). After installing the server you should run the
following command:

```shell
synnax start --insecure --memory
```

Next, you will want to run the simulated DAQ. You can do this by downloading the [Python
script](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/blob/main/client/py/examples/control/press/simulated_daq.py)
from the Synnax GitHub repository. After downloading the script, run the following
command:

```shell
python simulated_daq.py
```

<Note variant="info">
    Python can be tricky to get installed and running properly. If you are having
    troubles, please visit our [Python troubleshooting
    guide](/reference/python-client/troubleshooting).
</Note>

Now its, time to open the Synnax Console to set up two visualizations of the tank. After
opening the console, you can connect to the cluster using the same connection parameters
in the Python script.

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/connect-cluster" />

Now, we will setup a [schematic](/reference/console/schematics) of our tank and valves:

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/schematic" />

In the schematic, make sure there are the following components:

-   Value
    -   Input Channel: sensor_0
-   Valve
    -   State Channel: valve_response_0
    -   Command Channel: valve_command_0
-   Valve
    -   State Channel: valve_response_1
    -   Command Channel: valve_command_1

Once the schematic is set up, you can enter [control
mode](/reference/console/schematics#control-mode) to manually control the valves.

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/control" />

Now, you can set up a [line plot](/reference/console/line-plots) to view a plot of the
pressure in the tank:

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/line-plot" />

Once you finished setting up the line plot, your console should look like this:

<Image client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/workspace" />

Now, it's time to run your control sequence. You can do this by running the Python
script from earlier:

```shell
python control_sequence.py
```

You should see this result on the console:

<Video client:only="react" id="guides/operations/automated-control/control-sequence" />
