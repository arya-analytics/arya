Synnax provides first-class support for Python. Our client delivers:

1. Direct integration with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html).
2. Tooling to implement automated control of your hardware.
3. Change data capture (CDC) infrastructure to build automated analysis pipelines.

And more. In this section, we'll cover how to install the client and authenticate with
a cluster.

## Installation

The `synnax` library requires Python 3.9 or higher, and can be installed directly using 
`pip` or with your package manager of choice:

```bash
pip install synnax
```

<div class="info">
<b>Note</b> - Python can be difficult to get installed and running correctly, so we've put together
a troubleshooting guide that you can reference [here](/python-client/troubleshooting).
</div>

## Authenticating with a Cluster

There are two ways to authenticate with a Synnax cluster: using the CLI to permanently
store your credentials, or by passing them directly to the client. We'll cover both.

### The Synnax Login Command

The easiest way to authenticate with a Synnax cluster is with the `login` command.
This will permanently store your credentials in the operating system's keychain,
and allow you to use the client without passing credentials directly. 

We highly recommend using this method when using Synnax for data analysis, as it makes
it easy to use the client in a Jupyter notebook and share scripts without accidentally
revealing your credentials.

To authenticate, run the following command:

```bash
synnax login
```

<div class="info">
<b>Note</b> - If you get the error `command not found`, you might not have Python scripts
in your `PATH` variable. See our troubleshooting guide [here]() for more information.
</div>

This command will prompt us for the following information:

```
Enter your Synnax connection parameters:
Host (localhost): # YOUR HOST 
Port (9090): # YOUR PORT 
Username (synnax): # YOUR USERNAME 
Password: # YOUR PASSWORD 
Secure connection? (y/n) (y):
```

For the last question, enter `y` if your cluster is running in secure mode, and `n` 
otherwise. If all goes well, you should see the following message:

```
Connection successful!
Saved credentials. You can now use the Synnax Client without having to log in. 
```

Now that you've authenticated, you can instantiate the client as follows:

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax()
```

### Passing Credentials Directly

Passing authentication parameters directly is ideal in scenarios where you'd like to
use configuration files or environment variables to store your credentials. We recommend
this approach when connecting to Synnax in custom applications and/or automated analysis
servers.

To authenticate directly, simply pass your connection parameters to the `Synnax` constructor:

```python
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax(
    host="demo.synnaxlabs.com",
    port=9090,
    username="synnax",
    password="seldon",
    secure=True
)
```

and retrieve data from channels. Here's an example with environment variables:

```python
import os
import synnax as sy

client = sy.Synnax(
    host=os.environ["SYNNAX_HOST"],
    port=int(os.environ["SYNNAX_PORT"]),
    username=os.environ["SYNNAX_USERNAME"],
    password=os.environ["SYNNAX_PASSWORD"],
    secure=bool(os.environ["SYNNAX_SECURE"])
)
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed and authenticated the client, you're ready to start using
Synnax! We recommend starting with the [Channels](/python-client/channels) section
to learn how to create channels and retrieve data from them.
