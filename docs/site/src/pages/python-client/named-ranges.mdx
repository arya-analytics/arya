Named ranges identify specific periods of time with a label. We can use the
Python client ot read and write telemetry and attach metadata to these named
ranges.

## Creating Named Ranges

To create a named range, we can use the `client.ranges.create` method:

```python
import synnax as sy
from datetime import datetime

my_named_range = client.ranges.create(
    # This name does not need to be unique, but it's a good idea to
    # pick something that will be easy to identify later.
    name="My Named Range",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 12:30:00")
        end = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 14:30:00")
    ),
)
```

Synnax will automatically generate a unique `UUID` key for the range.

### Creating a range if it doesn't exist

If we want to create a range only if one with the same name doesn't already exist,
we can pass in the `retrieve_if_name_exists` parameter:

```python
my_named_range = client.ranges.create(
    name="My Named Range",
    time_range=sy.TimeRange(
        start = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 12:30:00")
        end = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 14:30:00")
    ),
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

If a range with the same name already exists, Synnax will return the existing range
instead of creating a new one.

## Retrieving Named Ranges

As with creating a range, we can retrieve one using the `client.ranges.retrieve`
method

### Retrieving a single range

We can retrieve a named range by it's name or key.

```python
# By name
my_named_range = client.ranges.retrieve("My Named Range")

# By key
my_named_range = client.ranges.retrieve(my_named_range.key)
```

Not that Synnax will raise a `QueryError` if the named range does not exist or multiple
ranges with the given name exist.

### Retrieving multiple ranges

We can retrieve multiple ranges by passing a list of names or keys to the
`retrieve` method.

```python
# By name
my_named_ranges = client.ranges.retrieve(["My Named Range", "My Other Range"])

# By key
my_named_ranges = client.ranges.retrieve([my_named_range.key, my_other_range.key])
```

When providing a list, Synnax will not raise an error if a range cannot be found. 
Instead, the client will just omit the range from the returned list.

## Working with Channels

### Accessing channels

We can access the channels on a range as if they were class properties.

```python
my_named_range = client.ranges.retrieve("My Named Range")

# Using a property accessor
my_pressure_channel = my_named_range.pressure_2
# Using a dictionary accessor
my_pressure_channel = my_named_range["pressure_2"]
```

### Accessing multiple channels

We can also access multiple channels on the range by passing a regular expression to
our property accessor.

```python
my_named_range = client.ranges.retrieve("My Named Range")

# Returns an iterable object containing matching channels
my_pressure_channels = my_named_range["^pressure"]
```

If we try to access channel-specific methods on the returned object, such as a name or 
data, Synnax will raise `MultipleResultsError`. Instead, we should iterate over the 
returned list. Here's a simple example where we plot the data from all of our
pressure channels:

```python
import matplolib.pyplot as plt

for ch in my_named_range["^pressure"]:
    plt.plot(ch, my_named_range.timestamps, label=ch.name)
```

Note that this iteration pattern is valid even if we only have one channel that matches
our regular expression.

### Aliasing channels

Channels must maintain their original names, but situations arise where we'd like to give
a channel a more descriptive name in the context of a particular range. Named ranges allow
us to do just that.

Imagine we have a channel named `daq_analog_input_1` that we'd like to refer to as 
`tank_pressure` for a tank burst test. We can do this by aliasing the channel:

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve("Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Set our alias
burst_test.daq_analog_input_1.set_alias("pressure_2")

# We can also set an alias like this
burst_test.set_alias("daq_analog_input_1", "pressure_2")
```

We can now access the channel using its alias:

```python
tank_pressure = burst_test.tank_pressure
```

It's relevant to mention that subsequent calls to `set_alias` will overwrite the previous
alias. 

<div class="info">
<b>Note - </b> Aliases are only valid within the context of a named range. If you
try to access an aliased channel outside of the range, Synnax will not be able to
find it.
</div>

## Attaching Metadata

### Setting metadata

It's common to have non-telemetry information we'd like to attach to a particular range,
such as test configuration parameters, numeric results, part numbers, etc. We can attach
this metadata to a range using the `meta_data` property.

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve("Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Set a single key/value pair
burst_test.meta_data.set("part_number", "12345")

# Another way to set a single key/value pair
burst_test.meta_data["part_number"] = "12345"

# Set multiple key/value pairs
burst_test.meta_data.set({
    "part_number": "12345",
    "test_configuration": "Test 1",
    "test_result": "123.45",
})
```

<div class="info">
<b>Note - </b> All metadata values are stored as strings. It's up to you to correctly
cast the values to the appropriate type. We're working on a way to automatically cast
values based on a schema.
</div>

### Retrieving metadata

Retrieving metadata is just as easy as setting it. 

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve("Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Retrieve a single key
part_number = burst_test.meta_data.get("part_number")

# Another way to retrieve a single key
part_number = burst_test.meta_data["part_number"]
```
 
### Deleting metadata

We can delete metadata using the `delete` method.

```python
burst_test = client.ranges.retrieve("Oct 10 Burst Test")

# Delete a single key
burst_test.meta_data.delete("part_number")

# Another way to delete a single key
del burst_test.meta_data["part_number"]

# Delete multiple keys
burst_test.meta_data.delete(["part_number", "test_configuration"])
```

## Deleting Named Ranges

Deleting a named range is as simple as passing in its name or key to the `delete` method.

```python
client.ranges.delete("My Named Range")
client.ranges.delete(my_named_range.key)
```

<div class="info">
<b>Note - </b> Deleting a range by name will delete <i>all</i> ranges with that name. Be careful!
</div>

We can also delete multiple ranges by passing a list of names or keys to the `delete`
method.

```python
client.ranges.delete(["My Named Range", "My Other Range"])
client.ranges.delete([my_named_range.key, my_other_range.key])
```
