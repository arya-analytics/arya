## Installing Python

Synnax doesn't enforce a specific way to work with Python, although our development team 
recommends using the latest version of the official Python installer, which 
can be found on the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.
This will ensure that the `python` command is available in your terminal.

Alternatively, if you have [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

Synnax requires Python 3.10 or higher to work correctly. You can check your Python
version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If you get an output saying `Python 3.10.x` or higher, you're good to go! If the output
is a different version, or just says `command not found`, keep reading.

Some systems have multiple Python versions installed, and the `python` command may point
to an older version than the most recent one available. Try running the following
commands to see if you have a newer version of Python installed under a different name:

```bash
python3 --version
python3.10 --version
python3.11 --version
```

If any of these commands output a version number at or above `3.10`, you can use that
command instead of `python` to work with Synnax.

### Python is not available on your PATH

If you've checked for alternative commands and still get an older version or
`command not found` error, it's likely that Python is not available on your `PATH`.

#### Find where Python is installed

To fix this issue, you'll first need to find where Python is installed on your system.
If you've used the official installer, it's likely that Python is installed in one of
`C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python{version}` where `{username}` is your
username and `{version}` is the version of Python you have installed. If you're using 
Anaconda, Python is typically installed in `C:\Users\{username}\Anaconda3`.

If neither of these locations exist, you may need to [reinstall Python](#installing-python).

#### Add Python to your PATH

Once you've found where Python is installed, you'll need to modify your `PATH` variable
to include it. To do this, open the Start Menu and search for "environment variables".
Click on "Edit the system environment variables" and then click "Environment Variables"
in the window that pops up.

In the "System Variables" section, find the variable named `Path` and click "Edit".
In the window that pops up, click "New" and enter the path to your Python installation
directory. Click "OK" to save your changes.

Finally, you'll need to **log out and log back in for your changes to take effect**. 
Alternatively, you can restart your computer to apply these changes. Once finished, 
retry the command listed above to check your Python version.

#### Still not working?

If you've followed the steps above and still can't get Python to display the correct
version, your `PATH` variable may have multiple Python installations listed, where an 
earlier version overrides the newer one. Try searching through your `PATH` variable for
any other Python installations and remove them.

## Incorrect Python Version or Command Not Found

Synnax requires Python 3.10 or higher to work correctly. You can check your Python
version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If you get an output saying `Python 3.10.x` or higher, you're good to go! If the output

### Python verison is out of date

If your Python version is out of date, you can update it by running:

```bash
brew upgrade python
```

Repeat the steps above to check your Python version again. If you still get an older
version, keep reading.

### Python command is under a different name

Some systems have multiple Python versions installed, and the `python` command may point
to an older version than the most recent one available. Try running the following
commands to see if you have a newer version of Python installed under a different name:

#### Add Python to your PATH

Once you've found where Python is installed, you'll need to modify your `PATH` variable
to include it. To do this temporarily, run the following command:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
```

To make this change permanent, you'll need to edit your `~/.zshrc` file or `~/.bashrc`
file. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then, you'll need to refresh your terminal by running:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Finally, retry the command listed above to check your Python version.

## Synnax Command Not Found

If you've installed Synnax using `pip`, you may get a `command not found` error when 
running the `synnax` command. 

### Check your pip version

The first culprit may be an incorrect version of pip. To check your version, run

```bash
pip --version
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
At the end of the output, you should see `(python3.10)` or higher in parenthesis. If 
you have python 3.10 or higher installed, but the version in parenthesis is lower,
yoru `PATH` variable may be pointing to the wrong version of `pip`.

If you installed Python using homebrew, `pip` should be installed in 
`/opt/homebrew/bin/pip{version}` where `{version}` is the version of Python you have 
installed. As outlined in [Python is not available on your PATH](#python-is-not-available-on-your-path),
make sure that `/opt/homebrew/bin` is in your `PATH` variable.

### If you've installed Synnax in a virtual environment

If you've installed Synnax in a virtual environment, you'll need to activate that
environment before running the `synnax` command. For example, if you're using `poetry`,
you'll need to run:

```bash
poetry shell
```

before running the `synnax` command.

## Installing Python

Ubuntu 22.04 comes with Python 3.10 pre-installed. If you're using an older version of
Ubuntu or want the latest version of Python, we recommend using the `deadsnakes` PPA
along with `apt`.

First we need to update the local package index:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Then we need to install common dependencies tha require python:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential software-properties-common -y
```

Next, we need to add the `deadsnakes` PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

Then we need to re-update the local package index:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Finally, we can install Python 3.11:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.11 -y
```

We can check that Python 3.11 is installed by running:

```bash
python3.11 --version
```

<b>Note - </b> If you have multiple versions of Python installed, running the `python`
command may point to an older version than the most recent one available.
