Synnax supports several different ways of reading data from a cluster. We can read 
directly from a channel, fetch a namd range and access it's data, or leverage server
side iterators for processing large queries.

## Reading from a Channel

The simplest way to read data from Synnax is to use the `read` method on the `Channel`
class. 

```python
from datetime import datetime

channel = client.channels.retrieve("my_precise_tc")

start = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 12:30:00")
end = datetime.datetime("2023-2-12 14:30:00")

data = channel.read(start, end)
```

The returned data is an instance of the `Series` class, but for all intensive purposes
can be treated exactly like a `numpy.ndarray`. For example, we cna perform vectorized
operations on the data.

```python
data = data - 273.15
```

The `Series` class does give us some additional functionality. Most notably, we can
get the time range occupied by the data.

```python
tr = data.time_range
print(tr)
# 2023-02-12 12:30:00 - 2023-02-12 14:30:00
```

This method is important, as it's not always the case that data exists for the entire
time range queried.

## Reading from Multiple Channels

We can also read from multiple channels at once by calling the `read` method on the
`Client` class. This method takes a list of channel names/keys and a time range.

```python
frame = client.read_frame(start, end, ["my_precise_tc", "time"])
```

The returned data is an instance of the `Frame` class. We can access `Series` on the
class by using the `[]` operator.

```python
data = frame["my_precise_tc"]
```

We can also convert the `Frame` to a `pandas.DataFrame` by calling the `to_df`
method.

```python
df = frame.to_df()
```

## Reading from a named range

While the above methods are useful for executing precise reads, they require us to know
exactly the range of time we're interested in reading. [Named ranges](/python-client/named-ranges)
are a useful way of categorizing important time ranges in a cluster's data. We can read
directly from these named ranges.

We can access chanenl's on a `Range` object and call `read` on them to access their
data.

```python
rng = client.ranges.retrieve("My Interesting Test")

# Read the data from the channel
data = rng.m_precise_tc.read()

data = data - 273.15
```

It turns out that we don't even need to call the `read` method at all. We can just use
the channel name directly to perform operations on the data.

```python
data = rng.m_precise_tc - 273.15
```

We can also plot the data just as easily.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot time on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis
plt.plot(rng.time, rng.m_precise_tc)
```

## Reading with Iterators

Single, multi, and named reads will cover most use cases, but there are situations where 
it's necessary to process large volumes of data. Sometimes, these reads may be too large
to fit in memory.

Synnax supports server side iterators that allow us to process large queries in 
consistently sized chunks.


```python
with client.new_iterator(start, end, "my_precise_tc", chunk_size=100) as it:
    for frame in it:
        # Do something with the frame
```
