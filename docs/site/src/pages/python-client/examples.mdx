One of the best ways to learn how to use the Synnax Python dlient is to look over and run
examples. This page contains a list of links to examples that demonstrate how to perform 
various tasks.

## Examples

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Basic Read and Write](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/basic_read_write.py) | Demonstrates a basic read and write of channel data. |
| [Stream Write](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/stream_write.py) | Shows how to stream simulated sensor data to a set of channels. |
| [Live Stream](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/live_stream.py) | Shows how to live stream sensor data from a set of channels. Use this in conjunction with the `stream_write.py` example. |
| [Create Range](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/create_range.py) | Creates a named range and reads data from it. |
| [Load](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/load.py) | Creates a simulated data acquisition computer that writes a large amount of data to a set of channels. |
| [Create Many Channels](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/create_many_channels.py) | Shows how to create large numbers of channels in a cluster. |
| [Control](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client/py/examples/control) | Sets up a simulated data acquistion computer and then controls a simulated system with a control sequence. |
