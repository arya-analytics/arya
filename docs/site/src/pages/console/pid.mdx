## PID Overview

The PID tool is used to see a diagram of your physical or simulated system.
which will read live values. It also allows the user to exercise control over
various channels in the system in order to manually run a test or operation.

The video below lets you see how to launch a PID:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/pid-create-pid" />

An example PID from simulated sensor values is shown below:

<Image client:only="react" id="console/pid-into"  />

There are three modes that the PID viewer can be in: edit mode, view mode, and
control mode. These modes can be switched between by hovering over the toolbar
in the bottom left of the window. In edit mode, the PID elements can be moved to
arrange the display. In view mode, nothing happens while live telemetry comes
in. In control mode, the user can activate elements on the PID viewer to affect
the system state.

## Symbols
<Text.Text level="p"> The heart of the PID view is symbols. These symbols are a
visual representation of sensors, actuators, and anything else on a test system.
If the symbols are not appearing on the bottom of the screen, make sure to click
the visualization <Icon.Visualize/> icon in the bottom right. Synnax has a
collection of built-in symbols, such as valves, values, and buttons. To place a
symbol, drag and drop onto the screen. The properties of symbols are detailed
below. </Text.Text>

## Style
The style tab on a symbol allows users to edit the symbols label, size,
orientation, color, and other various visual properties. A value's units can
also be edited here. To edit this, click on a PID element on the diagram and
then click the "Properties" tab in the bottom right.

## Telemetry
The "Telemetry" tab is a property of the value element, and is only for elements
that receive data. The video below shows placing and setting a value:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/pid-configure-value" />

- "Input Channel" selects which channel data is being read from.
- "Precision" determines what precision values will appear on the PID. A
  precision number of 2 means that 2 decimal places will be seen.
- "Averaging Window" determines how many samples are averaged together to appear
  on the screen. If the value 2 is selected, the value displayed on screen will
  be the average of the last 2 values.

## Control
The "Control" tab is a property of any element that takes inputs and outputs. An
example of this is a valve.

- "Input Channel" is the channel that PID viewer reads from. For instance,
  acknowledgement channels are often used as the input channels.
- "Output Channel" is a write channel that Synnax writes to. This are often
  write channels on a DAQ. When you click on the PID element to actuate it, this
  channel is the one that gets changed.

## Connection lines
Every element has spots for connection lines / tubes. When hovering over an
element, places for these connections appear. You can then drag this line to
another element to draw a connection line on the PID viewer.

First, we can make a diagram off of the provided symbols such as valves, tanks,
and values. Just drag and drop to make what you want!

You can also click several items and align them:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/pid-align-items" />

## Changing Colors
Selecting multiple elements also allows you to change the color of all elements:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/pid-change-color" />

## Control mode
In control mode, elements on the PID are able to be activated for manual control
of the system. Clicking on an actionable element, such as a valve, switch, or
button, allows you to activate the output channel on that element. The circle on
the element shows what is in control. If the circle is blue, the current PID
view has control. If the circle is green, the current PID view has absolute
control. If the circle is red, the current PID view does not have control as the
element is part of an automated sequence or controlled by another PID view.

The color of the bar indicates what is controlling the elements on the PID.
There is a legend on the display indicating what controlling node is what color.
