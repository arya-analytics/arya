## Using a Writer

The `Writer` is designed for writing continuous streams of data to a Synnax cluster.
To keep things intuitive, the writer maintains a file-like interface that is similar
to an `io.Writer`. There are a few key differences, the most important being that a
writer is governed by a transaction. If you'd like to learn more about transactions
and how writes work in Synnax, check out the [concepts](/reference/concepts/writes)
page.

We'll create the following index-indexed channel pair to use as an example:

```go
import (
    "github.com/synnaxlabs/client"
    "github.com/synnaxlabs/x/telem"
)

timeIndex, err := client.Channels.Create(synnax.Channel{
    Name: "time",
    DataType: telem.TimeStampT,
    IsIndex: true,
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

myPreciseTc, err := client.Channels.Create(synnax.Channel{
    Name: "my_precise_tc",
    DataType: telem.Float32T,
    Index: timeIndex.Key,
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

w := client.OpenWriter(synnax.WriterConfig{
    Keys: []channel.Key{timeIndex.Key, myPreciseTc.Key},
    Start: time.Now(),
})
defer w.Close()
```
