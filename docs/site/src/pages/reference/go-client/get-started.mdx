Synnax provides a Go client that allows you to interact with a Synnax cluster. On this
page, we'll cover how to install the client and connect to a cluster.

## Installation

The `synnax` package is available on the go package registry, and can be installed using
the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/synnaxlabs/client
```

Installing `github.com/synnaxlabs/client` will also install the
`github.com/synnaxlabs/x/telem` package which includes useful primitives for working
with telemetry data.

## Connecting to a Cluster

To connect a cluster, use the `synnax.New` function along with the connection parameters
to your cluster.

```go
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/synnaxlabs/client"
)

client, err := synnax.New(synnax.Config{
    Host: "localhost",
    Port: 9090,
    Username: "synnax",
    Password: "password",
    Secure: false,
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

This will return an instance of the `Synnax` client, which you can use to interact with
the cluster.
