## Important Tabs

<Text.Text level="p">
The Synnax Console has several important properties in it. First, there are four
main tabs that can be opened from the side. These are the <Icon.Resources/>
__Resources__, <Icon.Range/> __Ranges__, <Icon.Visualize/> __Visualizations__,
and <Icon.Cluster/> __Clusters__ tabs.
</Text.Text>

### Resources

<Text.Text level="p">
The <Icon.Resources/> __Resources__ tab list a file tree with folders for
channels, ranges, users, and workspaces.
</Text.Text>

- [Channels](/reference/concepts/channels) are the sensor channels that you can
  track and plot.
- [Ranges](querying-data) are saved times that you can use
  when loading data to view.
- __Users__ are a list of all users registered in the cluster. The workspaces
  created by the users can be found underneath their name.
- [Workspaces](workspaces) list all created workspaces in
  the cluster. This tree includes workspaces created by all users.

### Ranges

<Text.Text level="p">
You can view and create active ranges on the right by clicking the <Icon.Range/>
__Ranges__ icon. More information about ranges are covered in [Querying Data Using Ranges](querying-data).
</Text.Text>

<Video client:only="react" id="console/new-range" />

### Visualization Properties

<Text.Text level="p">
When you have a visualization open, such as a PID or Line Plot, you can open the
visualization properties by clicking the __Visualize__ <Icon.Visualize/> icon in
the bottom-right. This allows you to show or hide visualization properties for a
cleaner view.
</Text.Text>

### Clusters

<Text.Text level="p">
The list of clusters that you are connected to is found by clicking on the
__Cluster__ <Icon.Cluster/> icon in the bottom-right. This opens up a list of
all available clusters. You can add new clusters from here. Also, you can switch
your current active cluster. The text in the corner indicates whether you are
connected, disconnected, or have a failed connection with the cluster. More
information about clusters can be found in the page about [connecting a
cluster](connect-a-cluster).

## Window Management

The Synnax Console can be easily manipulated to help choose the exact display
you want.

You can easily open and close toolbars on Synnax:

You can close toolbars either by touching the respective icon or resizing it to the
edge:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview-close-visualizations" />

You can also have multiple visualizations displayed at the same time:

### Search Toolbar

The search toolbar at the top can be used to search for resources or to toggle
commands. Searching for resouces can be done by searching or pressing
`ctrl`+`P`.As an example of searching for resources, you could search for a test
range and then have it automatically added as an active range:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview-toolbar-open-range" />

The search toolbar can run commands by entering a "`>`" or pressing
`ctrl`+`shift`+`P`.This allows you to run commands such as toggling the color
theme, creating a visualization, adding a range, or opening the documentation:
