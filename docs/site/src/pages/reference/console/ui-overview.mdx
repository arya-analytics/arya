The Synnax Console provides a flexible environment to display and interact with data
stored and streamed through a Synnax cluster. It's interface is designed around two main
UI elements: the central layout mosaic and side toolbars.

The central mosaic displays visualizations such as line plots and schematics, while the
toolbars exists to provide access to resources, data ranges, and visualization controls.

To kick things off, we'll walk you through each of the toolbars and their 
functionality.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Resource</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/reference/concepts/channels">Channels</a></td>
      <td>Channels are the sensor channels that you can track and plot.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/reference/console/querying-data">Ranges</a></td>
      <td>Ranges are saved times that you can use when loading data to view.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Users</td>
      <td>Users are a list of all users registered in the cluster. The workspaces created by the users can be found underneath their name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Workspaces</td>
      <td>Workspaces list all created workspaces in the cluster. This tree includes workspaces created by all users.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### <Icon.Cluster /> Clusters

<Text.Text level="p">
The list of clusters that you are connected to is found by clicking on the
cluster (<Icon.Cluster/>) icon in the bottom-right. This opens up a list of
all available clusters. You can add new clusters from here. Also, you can switch
your current active cluster. The text in the corner indicates whether you are
connected, disconnected, or have a failed connection with the cluster. More
information about clusters can be found in the page about [connecting a
cluster](connect-a-cluster).

## The Central Mosaic

The Synnax Console can be easily manipulated to help choose the exact display
you want.

You can easily open and close toolbars on Synnax:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview-open-toolbars" />

You can close toolbars either by touching the respective icon or resizing it to the
edge:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview-close-visualizations" />

You can also have multiple visualizations displayed at the same time:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview-two-tabs" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Getting Help

<Text.Text level="p">
The Synnax documentation can be opened from within the Synnax Console by
clicking the <Icon.QuestionMark/> icon.
</Text.Text>

### Search Toolbar

The search toolbar at the top can be used to search for resources or to toggle
commands. Searching for resouces can be done by searching or pressing
`ctrl`+`P`.As an example of searching for resources, you could search for a test
range and then have it automatically added as an active range:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ui-overview-toolbar-open-range" />

The search toolbar can run commands by entering a "`>`" or pressing
`ctrl`+`shift`+`P`.This allows you to run commands such as toggling the color
theme, creating a visualization, adding a range, or opening the documentation:
