## Important Tabs

<Text.Text level="p">
The Synnax Console has several important properties in it. First, there are
four main tabs that can be opened from the side. These are the
<Icon.Resources/> __Resources__, <Icon.Range/> __Ranges__, <Icon.Visualize/>
__Visualizations__, and <Icon.Cluster/> __Clusters__ tabs.
</Text.Text>

### Resources

<Text.Text level="p">
The <Icon.Resources/> __Resources__ tab list a file tree with folders for
channels, ranges, users, and workspaces.
</Text.Text>

__Insert a video of opening the Resources file tree.__

- [Channels](/components/concepts/channels) are the sensor channels that you can
  track and plot.
- [Ranges](querying-data) are saved times that you can use
  when loading data to view.
- __Users__ are a list of all users registered in the cluster. The workspaces
  created by the users can be found underneath their name.
- [Workspaces](workspaces) list all created workspaces in
  the cluster. This tree includes workspaces created by all users.

### Ranges

<Text.Text level="p">
You can view and create active ranges on the right by clicking the <Icon.Range/>
__Ranges__ icon. More information about ranges are covered in [Querying Data
Using Ranges](querying-data).
</Text.Text>

__Insert a video of opening a range, typing in information, and saving to
Synnax.__

### Visualization Properties

<Text.Text level="p">
When you have a visualization open, you can open the visualization properties by
clicking the __Visualize__ <Icon.Visualize/> icon in the bottom-right. This
allows you to show or hide the properties of visualizations.
</Text.Text>

__Insert a video of opening and closing visualization properties.__

### Clusters

<Text.Text level="p">
The list of clusters that you are connected to is found by clicking on the
__Cluster__ <Icon.Cluster/> icon in the bottom-right. This opens up a list of
all available clusters. You can add new clusters from here. Also, you can switch
your current active cluster. The text in the corner indicates whether you are
connected, disconnected, or have a failed connection with the cluster. More
information about clusters can be found in the page about [connecting a
cluster](connect-a-cluster).

### Search Toolbar

The search toolbar at the top can be used to search for resources or to toggle
commands. Searching for resouces can be done by searching or pressing ctrl + P.
As an example of searching for resources, you could search for a test range and
then have it automatically added as an active range:

__Insert a video of adding a range using the toolbar.__

The search toolbar can run commands by entering a ">" or pressing ctrl + shift +
P. This allows you to run commands such as toggling the color theme:

__Insert a video of toggling the color theme through the toolbar.__
