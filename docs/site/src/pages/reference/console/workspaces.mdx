Workspaces in Synnax are collections of visualizations that can be used to load
certain views. For instance, you could be monitoring an entire plane on the
Synnax cluster, but have one workspace specifically for the fuel system and
another workspace for aerodynamic sensors.

## Creating a New Workspace

**Workspace** <Icon.Workspace/> icon. This allows you to add a new workspace.
