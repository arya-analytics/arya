This page walks you through using [ranges](/reference/concepts/read-ranges) to
query sections of your cluster's data.

## Defining New Ranges

The primary means for accessing data in the Synnax console is through ranges. A
range is identified by a start timestamp, end timestamp, and name.

### Creating a New Range

Creating a range is simple: just just click the "Add Range" button in the range
toolbar and fill in the required fields. If you would like to save the range to
your local computer and not share it with the rest of the cluster, click "Save
Locally". If you want the range to be saved to the whole cluster, click "Save
Permanently".

### Local vs. Persisted Ranges

The difference between local and persisted range is that local ranges are _not_
saved to your cluster. What that means is if two users are connected to the same
cluster, a local range created by one user will not be visible to the other
user. When you clear the console's local storage, the local range will also be
lost. If you want to make sure your range is always accessible, save it as a
persisted range.

### Parameters for Creating a Range

<Table
    columns={[
        {
            key: "name",
            name: "Name",
        },
        {
            key: "description",
            name: "Description",
        },
    ]}
    data={[
        {
            name: "Name",
            description: "A name for identifying the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "From",
            description: "The date and time when the range starts.",
        },
        {
            name: "To",
            description: "The date and time when the range ends.",
        },
    ]}
/>

## Finding Existing Ranges

There are two ways to find existing ranges in the console: the resources toolbar
and the command and search palette.

### Resources Toolbar

The resources toolbar is located on the left side of the console, and can be
used to browse all of your cluster's resources, including ranges. All of your
ranges can be found under the "Ranges" section.

<Video
  client:only="react"
  id="console/range/resources"
  style={{width: "50%", marginLeft: "25%"}}
/>

We can load a specific range into our ranges toolbar by clicking on it.

### Command and Search Palette

The command and search palette is located in the top center of the console, and
can be used to search for cluster resources and execute commands. We can find a
permanently saved range just by typing its name into the palette.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/range/palette" />

Use the arrow keys to navigate the results, and press <Icon.Keyboard.Return />
to load the range you're interested in. You can also hover and click using your
mouse.
