The line plot visualization is the main visualization tool in Synnax. In this
visualization, you can graph data. An example visualization is shown below:

## Data Tab
The data tab has several properties underneath it:
- Y1 lets you select which channels to plot along the left-hand axis
- Y2 lets you select which channels to plot along the right-hand axis
- Ranges lets you select which time ranges to plot. Data will only be plotted
  that took place over these time ranges. If you select multiple ranges, the
  x-axis will scale to accomodate both.
    - _Rolling_ time ranges allow you to view the most recent time increment of
      data. These are intented for cases where the user wants live data to come
      into the line plot.
- X1 lets you select the x-axis to be scaled by a channel instead of time. Note
  that the only data shown will be the data from the selected time range.

## Lines Tab
The line tab has several properties underneath it:
- Label allows you to change what text appears for the channels in the graph
  legend.
- Line width lets you change how many pixels the lines are.
- Downsampling lets you change how many times the channels get plotted. If
  downsampling is n, it plots every nth data point.
- Color changes the color of the line on the graph.

## Axes Tab
<Text.Text level="p">
<ul>
  <li>Lower bound and upper bound decides the limits for the axes. The <Icon.Auto/> button enables auto-bounding on the graphs.</li>
  <li>Tick spacing determines how far apart the tick marks are.</li>
  <li>If you add a label, this will add a title to the axis.</li>
  <li>Label direction determines whether the letters in the label are vertical or horizontal.</li>
  <li>Label size determines the size of the label.</li>
</ul>
</Text.Text>

## Properties Tab
The properties tab has several properties underneath it:
- Title allows you to change the title of the plot. This will change it in the
  workspace tab and on the top of the graph.
- The title switch determines whether the title is viewed in the chart.
- The legend switch determines whether the legend is viewed in the chart.

## Navigating the plot
<Text.Text level="p">
  <ul>
    <li>Zoom on the plot by clicking the <Icon.Zoom/> icon in the bottom left or by pressing <Icon.Keyboard.Alt/> (Windows) / <Icon.Keyboard.Command/> (Mac)
        and left click. This will adjust the axes of the graph to the box made.</li>
    <li>Pan the plot by clicking <Icon.Pan/> in the bottom left or by pressing <Icon.Keyboard.Shift/> and left click.</li>
    <li>Select data by clicking <Icon.Selection/> in the bottom left or by pressing <Icon.Keyboard.Alt/> and left click. This box allows you to select data
        by dragging on the graph. After selecting data you can right click and copy the time range to be used in Python, TypeScript, or ISO formats.</li>
    <li>Reset the zoom by clicking <Icon.Expand/> in the bottom left or by pressing <Icon.Caret.Up/> and left click.</li>
    <li>Show the tooltip on hover by clicking <Icon.Tooltip/>.</li>
    <li>The slope button <Icon.Rule/> allows you to select two points on the graph and calculate the slope between them. It also allows you to see the difference
        in the x and y axes. To change the first point, press the 1 key and click on the graph. To change the second point, press the 2 key and click on the graph.</li>
    <li>Pause live plotting by pressing <Icon.Pause/> or pressing the H key.</li>
  </ul>
