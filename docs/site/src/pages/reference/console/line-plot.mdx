The Line Plot is the main visualization tool in the Synnax Console. The Line
Plot can be used to plot real-time data or historical data. It can plot one or
several channels along the y-axes, and the x-axis can be time or another
channel. An example Line Plot is shown below:

corner to pop up the visualization toolbar.

## Visualization Toolbar

### Data Tab
The data tab has several properties underneath it:
- Y1 lets you select which channels to plot along the left-hand axis.
- Y2 lets you select which channels to plot along the right-hand axis.
- Ranges lets you select which time ranges to plot. Data will only be plotted
  that took place over these time ranges. If you select multiple ranges, the
  x-axis will scale to accomodate both.
    - Rolling time ranges allow you to view the most recent time increment of
      data. These are intented for cases where the user wants to view live data.
- X1 lets you select the x-axis to be scaled by a channel instead of time. Note
  that the only data shown will be the data from range selected in Ranges.

### Lines Tab
The line tab has several properties underneath it:
- Label allows you to change what text appears for the channels in the graph
  legend. The label can be the channel name or a channel alias. Note that
  changing the label does _not_ change the _channel_ name.
- Line width lets you change how many pixels the lines are.
- Downsampling lets you change how many times the channels get plotted. If
  downsampling is n, it plots every nth data point.
- Color changes the color of the line on the graph.

### Axes Tab
<Text.Text level="p">
<ul>
  <li>Lower bound and upper bound decides the limits for the axes.
      The <Icon.Auto/> button enables auto-bounding on the graphs.</li>
  <li>Tick spacing determines how far apart the tick marks are in pixels on the screen.
      Synnax will automatically determine appropriate tick intecrements based on this information.</li>
  <li>If you add a label, this will add a title to the axis.</li>
  <li>Label direction determines whether the letters in the label are vertical or horizontal.</li>
  <li>Label size determines the size of the label.</li>
</ul>
</Text.Text>

### Properties Tab
The properties tab has several properties underneath it:
- Title allows you to change the title of the plot. This will change it in the
  workspace tab and on the top of the graph.
- The title switch determines whether the title is viewed in the chart.
- The legend switch determines whether the legend is viewed in the chart. Note
  that the legend can be moved around to any location on the plot.

## Navigating the Line Plot

### Zoom

<Text.Text level="p">
Zoom on the plot by clicking the <Icon.Zoom/> icon in the bottom-left or by
pressing `alt` (Windows) / `command` (Mac) and left click. This will adjust the
axes of the graph to the box made.
</Text.Text>

<Video client:only="react" id="console/line-plot-zoom" />

### Pan

<Text.Text level="p">
Pan the plot by clicking <Icon.Pan/> in the bottom left or by pressing `shift`
and left click.
</Text.Text>

<Video client:only="react" id="console/line-plot-pan" />

### Select Data
<Text.Text level="p">
Select data by clicking <Icon.Selection/> in the bottom left or by pressing
`alt`and left click. This box allows you to select data by dragging on the
graph. After selecting data you can right click and copy the time range to be
used in Python, TypeScript, or ISO formats.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/line-plot-select" />

### Reset Zoom
<Text.Text level="p">
Reset the zoom by clicking <Icon.Expand/> in the bottom left or by pressing `â†‘`
and left click.
</Text.Text>

### Slope

<Text.Text level="p">
The slope button <Icon.Rule/> allows you to select two points on the graph and
calculate the slope between them. It also allows you to see the difference in
the x and y axes. To change the first point, press the `1` key and click on the
graph. To change the second point, press the `2` key and click on the graph.
