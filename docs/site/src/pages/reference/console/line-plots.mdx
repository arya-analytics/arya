Line plots are the main visualization tool in the Synnax Console. Line plots can be used
to plot real-time data or historical data. They can plot one or several channels along
the y-axes, and the x-axis can be time or another channel. An example line plot is shown
below:

Click the visualize <Icon.Visualize /> button in the bottom-right corner to open the
visualization toolbar.

## Visualization Toolbar

### Data Tab

- **Y1** lets you select which channels to plot along the left-hand axis.
- **Y2** lets you select which channels to plot along the right-hand axis.
- **Ranges** lets you select which [time ranges](/reference/console/ranges) to plot.
  Data will only be plotted that took place over these time ranges. If you select
  multiple ranges, the x-axis will scale to accomodate both.
    - Rolling time ranges allow you to view the most recent time increment of data.
      These are intended for cases where you want to stream live data.
- **X1** scales the x-axis by a channel instead of time. Note that the only data shown
  will be the data from the time in the ranges selected.

### Lines Tab

- **Label** allows you to change what text appears for the channels in the line plot
  legend. The label can be the channel name or a channel alias. Note that changing the
  label does _not_ change the channel name.
- **Line Width** lets you change how thick the lines are.
- **Downsampling** lets you change how many times the channels get plotted. If
  downsampling is 5, every 5th data point is plotted.
- **Color** changes the color of the line on the line plot.

### Axes Tab

- **Lower Bound** and **Upper Bound** set the limits for the axes. The auto <Icon.Auto
  /> button enables auto-bounding on the line plots.
- **Tick Spacing** determines how far apart the tick marks are in pixels on the screen.
  Synnax will automatically determine appropriate tick increments based on this
  information.
- **Label** adds a title to the axis.
- **Label Direction** determines whether the letters in the label are vertical or
  horizontal.
- **Label Size** determines the size of the label.

### Properties Tab

- **Title** changes the title of the line plot. The title will change on the workspace
  tab and on top of the line plot.
- **Show Title** determines whether the title is visible on the line plot.
- **Show Legend** determines whether the legend is viewed in the chart. If the legend is
  visible, it can be moved to any location on the line plot.

## Navigating the Line Plot

In the bottom-left corner of the screen, there are options for navigating the line plot.

### Zoom

Zoom on the line plot by clicking the zoom <Icon.Zoom /> button in the or by pressing
<Icon.Keyboard.Alt /> (Windows) / <Icon.Keyboard.Option /> (MacOS) and left click. This
will adjust the axes of the line plot to the area of the box.

### Pan

Pan the line plot by clicking the pan <Icon.Pan /> button or by pressing
<Icon.Keyboard.Shift /> and left click.

### Select

Select data by clicking the selection <Icon.Selection /> button or by pressing
<Icon.Keyboard.Alt /> (Windows) / <Icon.Keyboard.Option /> (MacOS) and left click. This
box allows you to select data by dragging on the line plot. After selecting data you can
right click and copy the time range to be used in Python, TypeScript, or ISO formats.
You can also create a range from this selection.

### Reset Zoom

Reset the zoom by clicking the expand <Icon.Expand /> button or by pressing
<Icon.Keyboard.Control /> (Windows) / <Icon.Keyboard.Command /> (MacOS) and left click.

### Show Tooltip on Hover

Clicking the tooltip <Icon.Tooltip /> button will determine whether a tooltip is shown
when hovering over navigation options.

### Slope

The slope <Icon.Rule /> button allows you to select two points on the line plot and
calculate the slope between them. You can also see the difference in the x and y axes.
To change the first point, press the `1` key and click on the line plot. To change the
second point, press the `2` key and click on the line plot.

### Pause Live Plotting

Pressing the `H` key or clicking the pause <Icon.Pause /> button will pause live
plotting.
