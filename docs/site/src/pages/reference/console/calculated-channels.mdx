Calculated channels are used to analyze or transform real-time data from
existing [channels](/reference/console/channels). They can be used for a wide variety of
real-time data processing and analysis such as:

- scaling, converting or filtering raw data
- implementing sensor voting algorithms
- creating channels to conditionally trigger alarms/warnings

and much more.


## Creating Channels

You can create a channel using the "Create Calculated Channel" command in the Command Palette. To
open the palette, click on the search bar at the top and type ">". You can also open the
palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (MacOS).

## Calculated Channel Creation

### Parameters

When creating a calculated channel, you will be prompted to fill in the following fields.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>
        A name for the channel.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Type</td>
      <td>
        What data type the channel stores.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Expression</td>
       <td>
        The resulting python expression that represents the value written to the calculated channel. The
        the value written to the channel must be assigned to the `result` variable.
       </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Requires </td>
      <td>
        The existing channels necessary involved in the calculation expressed in the expression. A calculated channel must
        use **at least one channel**.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Calculated channels are [Virtual](/reference/concepts/channels#virtual-channels), meaning data written to them will not be stored permenantly.
### Rules for Calculations

#### Expressions are written in Python.

The calculations are specified as python expressions on existing channels in synnax. Expressions must be valid for
 **Python 3.11.7** and **Numpy 1.24.3**.

Expressions may contain several variable declarations and intermediate operations, but the final output to the channel
must be assigned to `result`. Below is an example of a calculated channel scaling and averaging 3 pressure readings.

#### Channels with hyphenated names are accessed with builtin `channels` dictionary

To perform operations on channels whose names contains hyphens, they must be accessed through the `channels` dictionary like so:

## Editing Calculations

You can edit an existing calculated channel by right clicking on it in the resource toolbar and selecting "Edit Calculation" from the menu.
