This page walks you through using [ranges](/reference/concepts/read-ranges) to
query sections of your cluster's data.

## Defining New Ranges

The primary means for accessing data in the Synnax console is through ranges. A
range is identified by a start timestamp, end timestamp, and name.

### Local Ranges

Local ranges exist only within your console, and are not persisted to the
cluster. They're quite useful for quickly exploring data, and can eventually be
converted to persisted ranges if you desire. To create a local range, click the
"Add Range" button in the ranges toolbar, and then click "Save Locally":

<Video client:only="react" id="console/new-range" />

{/* TODO: change video to new range format */}

### Persisted Ranges

Persisted ranges are saved permanently to the cluster, and can be accessed by
other members of your organization. Creating a persisted range is the same as
creating a local range, but you'll click the "Save Permanently" button instead:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/new-permanent-range" />

{/* TODO: Change video */}

### Parameters for Creating a Range

<Table
    columns={[
        {
            key: "name",
            name: "Name",
        },
        {
            key: "description",
            name: "Description",
        },
    ]}
    data={[
        {
            name: "Name",
            description: "A name for identifying the range.",
        },
        {
            name: "From",
            description: "The date and time when the range starts.",
        },
        {
            name: "To",
            description: "The date and time when the range ends.",
        },
    ]}
/>

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Finding Existing Ranges

There are two ways to find existing ranges in the console.: the resources tool
bar and the command and search palette.

### Resources Toolbar

The resources toolbar is located on the left side of the console, and can be
used to browse all of your cluster's resources, including ranges. All of your
ranges can be found under the "Ranges" section.

<Video
  client:only="react"
  id="console/range-resources"
  style={{width: "50%", marginLeft: "25%"}}
/>

We can load a specific range into our ranges toolbar by double clicking on it.

### Through the Command and Search Palette

The command and search palette is located in the top center of the console, and
can be used to search for cluster resources and execute commands. We can find a
permanently saved range just by typing its name into the palette.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/ranges-palette" />

Use the arrow keys to navigate the results, and press enter to load the range
you're interested in. You can also hover and click using your mouse.
