Logs are used to view telemetry in a log format. They are useful for viewing low speed 
sensor values, viewing and communicating control sequences states, and debugging 
operations.

## Creating a Log

To create a log, add a new tab and select the log visualization:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/logs/log-create" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Choosing a Channel

To start viewing data, the only option you need to select is the channel to
view data from. You can do this by clicking on the channel dropdown in the 
visualization toolbar.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/logs/choose-channel" />

## Pausing and Scrolling

To view historical data previously logged, simply scroll up. This will automatically
freeze the log window and allow you to scroll through the data. To resume live 
logging, simply scroll back down to the bottom of the log window.
