## Adding a New Cluster

Adding a new cluster is as simple as clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the
top right corner of the cluster toolbar and entering your connection parameters,
as shown below.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/cluster/connect" />

This will add a new cluster to the list and set it as active. The console
continuously monitors the connection to the cluster and displays it in the
bottom right corner of the UI.

### Parameters

<Table
  columns={[
    {
      key: "name",
      name: "Name"
    },
    {
      key: "description",
      name: "Description"
    }
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      name: "Name",
      description: "A human-readable name for the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Host",
      description: "The hostname or IP address of the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Port",
      description: "The port number of the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Username",
      description: "The username to use when connecting to the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Password",
      description: "The password to use when connecting to the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Secure",
      description:
        "Whether to use TLS when connecting to the cluster. This parameter only works with secure clusters."
    }
  ]}
/>

<Note variant="warning">
The console will not connect to remote clusters (i.e. host is not 'localhost')
started with the `--insecure` flag.
</Note>

### Demo Cluster
Synnax has a demo cluster that can be connected to which always plots some data.
To connect, enter the following parameters:

- __Host__: demo.synnaxlabs.com
- __Port__: 9090

## Cluster Toolbar

The cluster toolbar is located at the bottom right of the screen. From this
toolbar, you can add clusters, switch between them, and more.

If you have multiple clusters, you can switch between them by clicking on the
cluster you'd like to connect to in the toolbar:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/cluster/switch" />

Right-clicking on a cluster in the toolbar will open a context menu with options
to connect from, disconnect from, rename, and remove the cluster.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/cluster/context-menu" />

You can also copy a link to the cluster from the context menu. Opening this link
will open the Synnax Console with the cluster already connected.

<Note variant="warning">
Currently, opening by link is only supported on Mac. Other platforms are planned
to be supported in the future.
