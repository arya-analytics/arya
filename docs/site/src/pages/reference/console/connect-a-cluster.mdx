import Code from "@/components/code/Code.astro";
export const components = { pre: Code };

import { Video } from "@/components/Media";
import { Table } from "@/components/Table";
import Note from "@/components/Note.astro";
import { Text } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";
import { Divider } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

- [Started a cluster](/reference/cluster/quick-start)
- [Installed the Synnax console](get-started)

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Adding a New Cluster

Adding a new cluster is as simple as clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the
top right corner of the cluster toolbar and entering your connection parameters,
as shown below.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/connect-a-cluster" />

This will add a new cluster to the list and set it as active. The console
continuously monitors the connection to the cluster and displays it in the
bottom right corner of the UI.

### Parameters

<Table
  columns={[
    {
      key: "name",
      name: "Name"
    },
    {
      key: "description",
      name: "Description"
    }
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      name: "Name",
      description: "A human-readable name for the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Host",
      description: "The hostname or IP address of the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Port",
      description: "The port number of the cluster."
    },
    {
      name: "Username",
      description: "The username to use when connecting to the cluster. If you didn't set a username when starting the cluster, this defaults to 'synnax'."
    },
    {
      name: "Password",
      description: "The password to use when connecting to the cluster. If you didn't set a password when starting the cluster, this defaults to 'seldon'."
    },
    {
      name: "Secure",
      description:
        "A boolean value indicating whether to use TLS when connecting to the cluster. This parameter only works with secure clusters."
    }
  ]}
/>

<Note variant="warning">
The console will not connect to remote clusters (i.e. host is not 'localhost')
started with the `--insecure` flag.
</Note>

### Demo Cluster
Synnax has a demo cluster that can be connected to which always plots some data.
To connect, enter the following parameters:

- __Host__: demo.synnaxlabs.com
- __Port__: 9090
- __Username__: synnax
- __Password__: seldon
- __Secure__: True

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Switching Clusters

If you have multiple clusters, you can switch between them by double clicking on
the cluster you'd like to to connect in the toolbar:

<Video client:only="react" id="console/switch-clusters" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Next Steps

You can find a basic overview of the console UI on the [UI overview](ui-overview)
page.
