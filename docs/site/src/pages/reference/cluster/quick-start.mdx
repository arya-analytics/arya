This page will walk you through starting a single node Synnax cluster. To get
started, select your operating system below:

## Using Docker

The simplest way to start a single node cluster is by using the
`synnaxlabs/synnax` Docker image, simply run:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a single
node cluster with the following parameters:

`-p 9090:9090` - This maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container.
This allows access to the Synnax node from the host machine.

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for
learning and development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI Reference](cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Using Linux

To start a single node cluster on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux" />

Then, move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note variant="info">
You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment
variable. You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note>

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for
learning and development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI Reference](cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Using MacOS

To start a single node cluster on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="macos" />

Next, move the binary to `usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="macos" />

Then, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

<Note variant="info">
You'll need to make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment
variable. You can do this temporarily by running `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`.
</Note>

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for
learning and development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI Reference](cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Using Windows

To start a single node cluster on Windows, use the following script to download
the latest Synnax binary and move it into your `PATH`:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="windows" />

<Note variant="info">
We recommend adding `;$env:appdata/synnax` to your `PATH` environment variable,
which will allow you to execute synnax commands from any shell. See [Microsoft's Environment Variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.4#saving-changes-to-environment-variables)
documentation for more.
</Note>

To start the node, run this:

```powershell
synnax start --listen=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on.
This is the reachable address of the node, and is also the address that other
nodes will use to connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for
learning and development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

If you're interested in more details on these flags, see the [CLI
Reference](cli-reference).

To stop the node, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
