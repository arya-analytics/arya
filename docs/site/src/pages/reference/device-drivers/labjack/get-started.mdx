The [LabJack](https://support.labjack.com/docs/?l=en) LJM library allows 
Synnax to directly connect to your LabJack T-Series devices. This page will walk you through some of the important pre-requisites 
necessary to get started with the NI driver.

## Installation

The LabJack Driver comes pre-installed with every Synnax Deployment. 

### Installing LJM

The Labjack LJM library must be installed for Synnax to communicate with your
hardware. Instructions for installing LJM software can be found on the 
[LabJack website.](https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit)
<Note.Note variant="warning">
If you have a Synnax cluster already running before installing LJM, you'll need to 
restart the cluster for Synnax to recognize the LJM installation.

## OS Compatibility

The LabJack driver is only compatible when running the Synnax Database on a Windows machine.
The driver will not be able to find your devices when running on Linux, macOS, or 
within a Docker container (even if that container is running on Windows).
