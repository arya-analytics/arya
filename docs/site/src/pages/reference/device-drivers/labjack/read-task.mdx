The Read Task is used for acquiring analog and digital data from LabJack devices. In this guide,
we'll walk you through the steps to create a read Task in Synnax.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured an NI device 
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the [Configure Device](/reference/device-drivers/labjack/configure-device)
guide for more information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the LabJack 
Driver, a read task defines a background process that reads data from the 
analog/digital inputs on a particular DAQ card.

A read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We 
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up 
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## Important Rules for Read Tasks

There are a few important rules to keep in mind when creating a read task.

### Sample Rates

All channels in the task are sampled at the same rate. If you'd like to sample
different channels at different rates, create a separate task to do so.

#### Sampling Thermocouple channels

In order to leverage the LJM's built-in thermocouple features, configuring a task with
thermocouple channels will reduce the maximum reliable sample rate you can acquire data, 
compared to a task with only analog or digital input channels.

### One Running Task Per Channel

Synnax can only accept live data from a channel from one source at a time. If you have a task
running that reads from a `pressure` channel, you cannot start another task that reads from the same channel.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog
### From the Resources Toolbar

To create a read task from the resources toolbar, open the Synnax Console and 
click on the "Resources" tab in the left sidebar. Find the device you'd like to create
the task for, right-click on it, and select "Create read Task".

### From the Command Palette

To create a  read task from the command palette, open the Synnax Console and 
click on the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with 
`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type
"LabJack". You'll see an option called "Create a LabJack read Task". Select this
option to open the read task configuration dialog.

### From The Layout Selector

To create a read task from the layout selector, click on the "+" button in the 
top right corner and select "LabJack read Task".
