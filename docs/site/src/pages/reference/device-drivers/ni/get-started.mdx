The National Instruments (NI) device driver allows Synnax to directly connect to your NI 
hardware, including CompactDAQ, CompactRIO, and PXI systems. This page will walk you
through some of the important pre-requisites necessary to get started with the NI driver.

## Supported Devices

**Synnax supports reading and writing data to all National Instruments devices that are supported by the [NI-DAQmx driver](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html).**

Aside from very old DAQ modules, Synnax is generally compatible with every NI device.

## Installation

The NI Driver comes pre-installed with every Synnax Deployment. 

### Installing DAQmx

National Instruments' DAQmx drivers must be installed for Synnax to communicate with your
hardware. Instructions for installing DAQmx can be found on the [National Instruments website.](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710)

<Note variant="warning">
Synnax will not be able to communicate with your hardware if DAQmx is not installed.
</Note>

## OS Compatibility

The NI driver is only compatible when running the Synnax Database on a Windows machine. 
The driver will not be able to find your devices when running on Linux, macOS, or 
within a Docker container (even if that container is running on Windows).

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed DAQmx on your host machine, you're ready to start integrating
your devices. Check out the [Configure a Device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device) 
page to learn how to do so.
