The National Instruments (NI) device driver allows Synnax to directly connect to your NI 
hardware, including CompactDAQ, CompactRIO, and PXI systems. This page will walk you
through some of the important pre-requisites necessary to get started with the NI driver.

## Installation

The NI driver comes pre-installed with every Synnax Deployment. To use the driver, you
must have the [National Instruments DAQmx](https://www.ni.com/en/support/documentation/supplemental/06/getting-started-with-ni-daqmx--main-page.html)
libraries installed on your machine. **Without these libraries, the NI driver will not work.**

Instructions on installing the DAQmx libraries can be found on the [National Instruments website.](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710)

## OS Compatibility

The NI driver is only compatible when running the Synnax Cluster on a Windows machine. 
The driver will not be able to find your devices when running on Linux, macOS, or 
within a Docker container (even if that container is running on Windows).
