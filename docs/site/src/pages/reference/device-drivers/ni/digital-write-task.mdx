The Digital Write Task is used for sending commands to the digital outputs of your NI 
cards. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a Digital Write Task in Synnax.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured an NI device
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the [Configure Device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device)
guide for more information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, a read task defines a background process that reads data from the analog inputs 
on a particular DAQ card.

An Analog Read Task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We 
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up 
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## How Commands Work in Synnax

Commands in Synnax require two types of channels: a command channel and state channel.
Command channels are where you send commands to your hardware. To set a digital output 
to high, you would send a `1` to the command channel. To set it to low, you would send a `0`.

State channels represent the current state of the digital output. When you send a command,
the corresponding digital write task will process the command and update the value in
the state channel.
