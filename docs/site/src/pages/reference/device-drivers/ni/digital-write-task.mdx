The Digital Write Task is used for sending commands to the digital outputs of your NI 
cards. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a Digital Write Task in 
Synnax.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured an NI device
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the [Configure Device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device)
guide for more information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, a digital write task defines a background process that writes to the digital
outputs of your device.

An digital write task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We 
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up 
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## How Commands Work in Synnax

Commands in Synnax require two types of channels: a command channel and state channel.
Command channels are used to send commands to hardware. To set a digital output to high, 
you would write a `1` to the command channel. To set it to low, you would send a `0`.

State channels represent the current state of the digital output. When you send a command,
the corresponding digital write task will process the command and update the value in
the state channel.

As an example, to configure a valve in the [console schematic](/reference/console/schematic) 
to write to a digital output, you would set the output channel as the command channel
and the state channel as the input channel. Clicking the valve would send a command to
the digital output, and the valve would turn solid or transparent based on the state
channel.

### Open the Task Configuration Dialog

To configure a digital write task, open the Synnax Console and click on the Quick Search
& Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux
and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "NI".
You'll see an option called "Create a new Digital Write Task". Select this option
to open the task configuration dialog.

## Configure the Task

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Select your NI Device</StepText>

The first step is to select teh NI device you'd like to write to the outputs of. Use
the dropdown menu in the top left corner to do so.

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add the channels you'd like to write to. Click the "+" button in
the channels section. Then, click on the new channel in the list to configure it.

You'll need to select both a digital output port and line to write to. You'll also need
to select the command channel the task will listen to, and the state channel that will
be updated when the command is processed.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Configure the State Update Rate</StepText>

The state update rate determines how often the state channels in the task are updated.
Set the rate higher in scenarios that require quick response times. 

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Start the Task</StepText>

Once you've added all of the channels you need and have configured sampling rates, hit
the "Configure" button. If there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured
task and enable the "Play" button in the dialog. Click this button to start the task.
