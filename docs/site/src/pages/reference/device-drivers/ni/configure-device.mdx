The first step to start acquiring data and sending commands to your 
National Instruments (NI) hardware is to connect and configure your module.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using your NI hardware with Synnax, you will need to 
ensure that you have the following:

1. A Synnax [deployment](/reference/cluster/quick-start) running on your
network. This deployment must be running on a Windows machine that your NI hardware is connected
to.
2. The NI [DAQmx](https://www.ni.com/en/support/documentation/supplemental/06/getting-started-with-ni-daqmx--main-page.html)
drivers installed on the machine running the Synnax deployment. Installation instructions
can be found [here](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710).
3. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your local
machine.

## Overview

There are three main steps to configuring an NI device in Synnax:

1. Find and select the device you want to configure.
2. Define basic properties for the device.
3. Map ports and lines on your device to channels within Synnax.

Once you've completed these steps, you'll be ready to start defining tasks in order
to acquire data and send commands to your device.

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Select Device to Configure</StepText>

Synnax will automatically detect devices, and display a notification in the 
Console when a new device is connected. To start configuring the device,
simply click the "Configure" button in the notification.

Alternatively, you can find connected devices in the resources toolbar. To 
open the device configuration dialog, right click on the device and select
"Configure".

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}>Define Basic Properties</StepText>

Once you've opened the device configuration dialog, it's time to define some basic 
properties. We've automatically pre-populated values we think are reasonable, but
here's an overview of each property if you'd like to change them:

<Table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Serial Number</td>
            <td>The serial number of the device. This will uniquely identify the 
            device in Synnax. We recommend keeping the default value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Model</td>
            <td>The model of the card. This will help Synnax provide recommendations 
            when configuring tasks and creating channels. We recommend keeping the
            default value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>A human-readable name for the device. Feel free to change 
            this to anything you see fit.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Identifier</td>
            <td>A short, several character identifier for the device. This will be used
            to prefix channel names that correspond to this device. Change this to something
            meaningful to your team, but try to keep it short.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</Table>

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}>Create Channels</StepText>

The next step in the workflow is to map ports and lines on your device to channels 
within Synnax. We've automatically defined a reasonable mapping for your device. In
most cases, you won't need to change this. If you do, here's an overview of the
process for doing so.

### A Note on Channel Naming Conventions

Synnax will automatically name channels based on the device identifier, the channel type
(e.g. analog input, digital output), and the port/line number on the device. Although
the ports on your device often correspond to specific sensor types (i.e. pressure transducers),
we recommend keeping the channel name tied to the port/line number.

When running specific tests, you can define channel name aliases that can map these 
absolute names to sensor-specific ones.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.1}>Identify Sampling Groups</StepText>

Channels in the configuration dialog are organized into **sampling groups**. Each group
has a special "Index" channel that is used to store the timestamps for the samples
recorded by each channel in the group. Indexes are identified by a green 
<span style={{color: "var(--pluto-secondary-z)"}}>Index</span> tag next to their data type.

The important rule to remember is that **all channels in a group must be sampled together**.
For example, if you have an analog voltage channel `pxi_255_ai_0` and a thermocouple channel
`pxi_255_ai_1` that are within the same group, both channels must be sampled at the same rate.
It's not possible to sample `pxi_255_ai_0` at 1 kHz and `pxi_255_ai_1` at 10 Hz. 

It is possible, however, to disable sampling for a channel when configuring a 
[task](/reference/device-drivers/ni/read-task). For example, you could read from the `pxi_255_ai_0` channel without reading from the `pxi_255_ai_1` channel.
As long as you don't write to two different channels with the same index at the same time,
Synnax is happy.

<Note variant="info">
When in doubt about whether you'll need to sample channels at different rates, it's
best to split them into separate groups. Although it incurs a performance and storage 
overhead, it provides more flexibility in the future.
</Note>

#### Default Sampling Groups

Synnax will automatically create sampling groups for you based on the ports/lines on 
your device. Here's an overview of the default groups we create:

<Table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Analog Inputs</td>
            <td>All analog input channels on the device.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Digital Inputs</td>
            <td>All digital input channels on the device.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Analog Output Command</td>
            <td>A group with an index channel and a command channel. The command channel 
                will be used to send commands to an analog output channel on the device.
                Keeping each command channel in a separate group allows you to send commands
                independently to each analog output channel.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Analog Output States</td>
            <td>A group with an index channel and corresponding channels representing
                acknowledged states for each commanded analog output channel on the device. 
                These states will be updated by the driver when the device acknowledges a command.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Digital Output Command</td>
            <td>A group with an index channel and a command channel. The command channel
            will be used to send commands to a digital output channel on the device. 
            Keeping each command channel in a separate group allows you to send commands
            independently to each digital output channel.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Digital Output States</td>
            <td>A group with an index channel and corresponding channels representing
                acknowledged states for each commanded digital output channel on the device.
                These states will be updated by the driver when the device acknowledges a command.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</Table>

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.2}>Split Sampling Groups</StepText>

In the case where you'd like to split a sampling group, use the "+" button at the top
of the sampling groups list, then drag and drop channels between groups.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.3}>Edit Channel Properties</StepText>

To edit a channel's properties, simply click on the channel in the list. A dialog will
appear in the bottom panel. 

We only recommend adjusting the data type of the channel when you need an increase
in precisions (almost only for analog input channels). 

INSERT VIDEO HERE

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## <StepText level="h2" step={4}>Confirm</StepText>

After you'd defined your sampling groups, hit "Next" to move to the confirmation dialog.
Once you're ready to proceed, hit "Configure" and Synnax will create the necessary
channels in the database. Once that process completes, press "Done" to close the dialog.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Next Steps

Now that you've connected your device and created channel, it's time to set up data
acquisition and control tasks.
