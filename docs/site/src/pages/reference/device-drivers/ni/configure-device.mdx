The first step to start acquiring data and sending commands to your 
National Instruments (NI) hardware is to connect and configure your module.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using your NI hardware with Synnax, you will need to 
ensure that you have the following:

1. A Synnax [deployment](/reference/cluster/quick-start) running on your
network. This deployment must be running on a Windows machine that your NI hardware is connected
to.
2. The NI [DAQmx](https://www.ni.com/en/support/documentation/supplemental/06/getting-started-with-ni-daqmx--main-page.html)
drivers installed on the machine running the Synnax deployment. Installation instructions
can be found [here](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710).
3. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your local
machine.

<StepText level="h2" step={1}>Select a Device to Configure</StepText>

Synnax will automatically detect new NI modules, and display a notification in the 
Console when a new device is connected. To start configuring the device,
simply click the "Configure" button in the notification.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/configure-device/device-configure-from-notification" />

Alternatively, you can find connected devices in the resources toolbar. To 
open the device configuration dialog, right click on the device and select
"Configure".

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/configure-device/device-configure-from-resources" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

<StepText level="h2" step={2}>Name Your Device</StepText>

The first step in the configuration dialog will prompt you to name your device. This name
will be used for your team to identify the device in the Console.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/configure-device/device-configure-name" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

<StepText level="h2" step={3}>Set the Device Identifier</StepText>

Next, you'll need to set a short device identifier. This identifier will be used to prefix
the names of all of the channels on your device. We've automatically generated a few 
suggestions, although you're welcome to choose your own.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/configure-device/device-configure-id" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

<StepText level="h2" step={3}>Save the Configuration</StepText>

Once you're happy with the name and identifier, the last step is to save the configuration
by hitting the blue "Save" button in the bottom right corner.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/ni/configure-device/device-configure-save" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Next Steps

Now that you've configured your device, it's time to record data using a task. To read
data, you can start with a [Digital Read Task](/reference/device-drivers/ni/digital-read-task)
or an [Analog Read Task](/reference/device-drivers/ni/analog-read-task). To send commands, 
try a [Digital Write Task](/reference/device-drivers/ni/digital-write-task).
