The Digital Read Task is used for acquiring data from analog inputs on your NI devices. In
this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a digital read Task in Synnax.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected and configured an NI device
and created the relevant channels in Synnax. Check out the [Configure Device](/reference/device-drivers/ni/configure-device) 
guide for more information.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with hardware devices in Synnax. Tasks
can be used for both control and data acquisition purposes. In the context of the NI
Driver, a digital read task defines a background process that reads data from the 
analog inputs on a particular DAQ card.

A digital read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We 
permanently store the configuration of the task in Synnax, so it's easy to set up 
multiple tasks for different purposes.

## Important Rules for Digital Read Tasks

There are a few important rules to keep in mind when creating a digital read task.

### Sample Rates 

All channels in the task are sampled at the same rate. If you'd like to sample
different channels at different rates, create a separate task to do so.

### One Running Task Per Channel

Synnax can only accept live data from a channel from one source at a time. If you have 
a task running that reads from a `pressure` channel, you cannot start another task that
reads from the same channel.

### One Running Task per Index Channel

[Index channels](/reference/concepts/channels#channel-types) are use to store
the timestamps for your data channels. When you configure a task to read from a
data channel, Synnax will automatically generate timestamps for the
corresponding index channel, regardless of whether you've explicitly added it to
the task.

For example, imaging we two channels, `pressure` and `temperature` that share
the same index channel, `time`. If you configure a task to read from `pressure`,
Synnax will automatically generate timestamps for the `time` channel. If you
then configure a task to read from `temperature`, Synnax will not allow you to
start the task, as the `time` channel is already in use.

## Open the Task Configuration Dialog

To configure a digital read task, open the Synnax Console and click on the 
Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with 
`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type
"NI". You'll see an option called "Create a New Digital Read Task". Select this
option to open the read task configuration dialog.

## Configuring the Task

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Select your NI Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the NI device you'd like to read data from. Use the dropdown
menu in the top left corner to do so.

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add channels to read data from. Click on the "+" button in the
channels section. Then, click on the new channel in the list to configure it.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Configure Timing</StepText>

There are two parameters to control the timing of the task: the sample rate and the 
stream rate. The sample rate defines at how many samples per second the task will read
from the device. The stream rate defines how often the task will stream data into Synnax.

For example, if you set the sample rate to 10 Hz and the stream rate to 1 Hz, Synnax will
read a batch of 10 samples every second, and then forward the entire batch to the server.

For very low rate tasks (&lt; 50Hz), we recommend setting the stream rate to the same value
as the sample rate. For higher rate tasks, lowering the stream rate can significantly 
improve performance. It's typically best to keep the stream rate below 50Hz unless you need
to quickly process incoming data in real-time.

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Enable/Disable Data Saving</StepText>

Data saving defines whether acquired data will be permanently stored in Synnax. When
enabled, Synnax will both stream and store data. When disabled, Synnax will only
stream data for real-time visualization. Historical data will not be available for review.

### <StepText level="h3" step={6}>Configure and Start the Task</StepText>

Once you'd added all of the channels you need and have configured sampling rates, hit
the "Configure" button. If there are no errors, Synnax will acknowledge the configured 
task and enable the "Play" button in the dialog. Click this button to start the task.
