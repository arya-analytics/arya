The first step to acquiring data from your PLC is to connect to to an OPC UA
server running on the device. 

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites

Before you can connect to an OPC UA server, you'll need to have the following
configured:

1. A Synnax [deployment](/reference/cluster/quick-start) running on your
   network.
2. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your
   machine.
3. An OPC UA compliant server running on your device. This server should be
reachable from the Synnax database deployment.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## <StepText level="h2" step={1}>Open the Connection Dialog</StepText>

We'll use the Console's configuration workflow to connect to your server. To
kick things off, open the Console and click on the Quick Search & Command
Palette at the top. You can also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on
Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type
"OPC UA". You'll see an option called "Connect a New Server". Select this open
to open the server configuration dialog.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## <StepText level="h2" step={2}>Configure the Connection</StepText>

The dialog will prompt you to enter the connection parameters to your server.
Here's a reference for each of the fields you'll need to fill:

<Table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>A human-readable name for your server. We'll use this to identify and manage the server in the Console.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Endpoint</td>
            <td>The endpoint URL for your server. This should be it's reachable address on the network, and typically begins with `opc.tcp://`.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Username</td>
            <td>The username to use when connecting to the server. This is optional and can be left blank.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Password</td>
            <td>The password to use when connecting to the server. This is optional and can be left blank.</td>

            <td>Security Mode</td>
            <td>
                The security mode to use when connecting to the server. This should match the security mode configured on the server:
                - **None**: No security is applied.
                - **Sign**: Messages are signed but not encrypted. Requires authentication but does not guarantee confidentiality.
                - **SignAndEncrypt**: Messages are signed and encrypted, ensuring authenticity and confidentiality.

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</Table>

### <StepText level="h3" step={2.1}>Test the Connection</StepText>

Before moving on to the next step, make sure to use the "Test Connection" button
to verify that the Console can connect to the server. Here's a quick video to
show you how to do this:

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/opcua/configure/connect-server" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

After you've successfully connected the server, hit "Next" to continue to the
next step in the workflow. 

## <StepText level="h2" step={3}>Create Synnax Channels</StepText>

The next step in the workflow is to create the channels in the Synnax database
that correspond to the nodes on your server. Synnax will automatically scan your
server for nodes and present them as a list along with their data types, paths,
and browseable names.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.1}>Identify Sampling Groups</StepText>

Channels in the configuration dialog are organized into **sampling groups**.
Each group has a special Index channel that is used to store the timestamps for
the samples recorded by each channel in the group. Indexes are identified by a
green <span style={{color: "var(--pluto-secondary-z)"}}>Index</span> badge
underneath their data type.

The important rule to remember is that **all channels in a group must be sampled
together**. For example, if you have a `temperature` and a `pressure` channel in
the same group, both channels must be sample at the same rate. It's not possible
to sample `temperature` at 1 kHz and `pressure` at 10 Hz in the same group.

It is possible, however, to disable sampling for a channel when configuring a
[task](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/read-task). For example, you could read
from the `temperature` channel without reading from the `pressure` channel. As
long as you don't write to two different channels with the same index at the
same time, Synnax is happy.

We've automatically placed all detected channels into a single group. To create
additional sampling groups, click the `+` button in the groups section of the
dialog. You can then drag and drop channels between groups to organize them as
needed.

By default, we place all of the channels into a single sample sampling group.
You can create additional groups by using the `+` button in the groups section
of the configuration dialog. Then, drag and drop channels between groups to
organize them as needed.

<Note variant="info">
When in doubt, separate channels into different groups.
Although it incurs a performance and storage overhead to store the timestamps
for each group, it provides a higher degree of flexibility in the future.
</Note>

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/opcua/configure/sampling-groups"
/>

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.2}>Remove Undesired Channels</StepText>

If you have channels that you don't want to create in Synnax, simply select them
(using standard `Shift` and `Ctrl`/`Cmd` modifiers), right click, and select
"Remove". This will remove the channel from the list and prevent it from being
created in the database.

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/opcua/configure/remove-channels"
/>

The namespace and the numeric identifier of the OPCUA node associated with the Synnax
channel is displayed below the name labeled as `NS` and `I` respectively. 

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.3}>Edit Channel Properties</StepText>

To edit the properties of a channel, simply select it and it's properties will
appear in the bottom panel. Feel free to adjust the name, data type, and
corresponding node as needed.  

<Video client:only="react" id="device-drivers/opcua/configure/channel-props" />

<Note variant="warning">
Be careful when changing the data type of the channel.
Some data types will not have the sufficient precision to store the data from
your node. If you're ok with the loss of precision, Synnax will automatically
convert the data to the new type when it reads from the OPC UA server.
</Note>

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.4}>Correctly Configure Indexes</StepText>

By default, we add a generically named `Time` index to each group (we recommend
renaming this to something more specific such as `my_opc_server_g1_time`). By
default, this index will have its timestamps generated by the Synnax driver
instead of reading them from the OPC UA server. This works for low-timing
precision applications.

For high data rates and precise applications, we recommend reading timing
information from the server, delete this channel, find the correct node you'd
like to read timestamps from, and toggle the switch in its properties to mark it
as an index.

Synnax stores timestamps as 64-bit precision integers in nanoseconds from the
unix epoch in UTC. We recommend using OPC UA's `DateTime` data type for
timestamps. We'll automatically convert these values to the correct format when
we read them from the server. It's also possible to use `Int64` or `UInt64` data
types, but you'll need to ensure that the server records the timestamps in the
correct format.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Considerations for High Data Rates 

For most use cases, Synnax is configured to read data from your server in single
sample batches. Depending on the PLC, OPC UA Server, and network configuration,
this configuration works well for applications up to 250 Hz. 

For higher data rates, we recommend configuring your server to expose data in
arrays. Synnax can then read these arrays in as 'chunks', reading many samples
with a single request. We've successfully tested this configuration up to 10
kHz. Correctly setting up your PLC to record data in an array based
configuration is more complicated. Here's how to do it.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.5}>Configure Channels for Array Nodes</StepText>

In your PLC software, configure your OPC UA server to expose arrays of samples
as nodes as opposed to single samples. We recommend the length of these arrays
to be a multiple between 20 and 30 times smaller than your desired sampling
rates. For example, if you want to sample at 1 kHz, we recommend setting the
array length to 33 samples (~1000/30). This means that Synnax will read 33
samples in a batch, streaming them at a rate of 33 Hz for visualization and
real-time analysis.

For array based sampling to work correctly, **all nodes in the sampling group
must be array nodes, and all nodes in the group must have the same length**.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3.6}>Timing Considerations</StepText>

When using array based sampling, we highly recommend reading the timestamps from
the OPC UA server. Synnax cannot determine the correct timestamps for each
sample in the array, and will interpolate based on the time of the request and
the data rate. 

We recommend setting up a node containing an array of `DateTime` values, and
marking that as your index for the sampling group. Here's an example
configuration for high sampling from two data channels and a timestamp channel:

<Image client:only="react"
id="device-drivers/opcua/configure/high-rate-example-config" />

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## <StepText level="h2" step={4}>Confirm</StepText>

After you've defined your sampling groups, hit "Next" to move to the
configuration dialog. Once you're ready to proceed, hit "Configure" and Synnax
will create the channels in the database. Once that process completes, press
"Done" to close the dialog.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Next Steps

Now that you've connected to your server and created channels, it's time to set
up data acquisition tasks. We recommend starting with the [Read
Task](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/read-task) to read data from your server.
