The first step to acquiring data from your PLC is to connect to to an OPC UA server 
running on the device. 

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Pre-requisites

Before you can connect to an OPC UA server, you'll need to have the following configured:

1. A Synnax [deployment](/reference/cluster/quick-start) running on your network.
2. The [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started) installed on your machine.
3. An OPC UA compliant server running on your device. This server should be reachable 
from the Synnax database deployment.

## Connecting to the Server

We'll use the Console's configuration workflow to connect to your server. To kick things off,
open the Console and click on the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. You can also
open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "OPC UA".
You'll see an option called "Connect a New Server". Select this open to open the server 
configuration dialog.

### Step 1 - Enter your Connection Parameters

The dialog will prompt you to enter the connection parameters to your server. Here's
a reference for each of the fields you'll need to fill:

<Table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>A human-readbale name for your server. We'll use this to identify and manage the server in the Console.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Endpoint</td>
            <td>The endpoint URL for your server. This should be it's reachable address on the network, and typicaly begins with `opc.tcp://`.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Username</td>
            <td>The username to use when connecting to the server. This is optional and can be left blank.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Password</td>
            <td>The password to use when connecting to the server. This is optional and can be left blank.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</Table>

### Step 1b - Test the Connection

Before moving on to the next step, make sure to use the "Test Connection" button to 
verify that the Console can connect to the server. 

### Step 2 - Create Synnax Channels

After you've successfully connected the server, hit "Next" to continue to the next step
in the workflow. Synnax will automatically scan your server for readable OPC UA nodes and
create a plan to create the corresponding channels in the Synnax database.

These channels are separated into independent **sampling groups**. Each group has a special
channel called an 'index' that is used to store the timestamps for the samples recorded
by each channel in the group. The important rule to remember is that **all channels in a 
group must be sampled together**. 

For example, if you have a `temperature` and a `pressure` channel in the same group,
both channels must be sampled at the same rate. This is because the index channel is 
used to store the timestamps for both channels, and the timestamps must be in sync.

By default, we place all of the channnels into a single sample sampling group. You 
can create additional groups by using the `+` button in the groups section of the 
configuration dialog. Then, drag and drop channels between groups to organize them as
needed.

<Note variant="info">
When in doubt, separate channels into different groups. Although it incurs a performance
and storage overhead to store the timestamps for each group, it provides a higher degree
of flexibility in the future.
</Note>

You can always come back to this dialog to re-configure the device at a later time.

### Step 3 - Confirm

After you've defined your sampling groups, hit "Next" to move to the configuration dialog.
Once you're ready to proceed, hit "Configure" and Synnax will create the channels in the
database. Once that process completes, press "Done" to close the dialog.

## Next Steps

Now that you've connected to your server and created channels, it's time to set up 
data acqusition tasks. We recommend starting with the [Read Task](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/read-task)
to read data from your server.
