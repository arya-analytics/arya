Read tasks are the primary method for acquiring data from a PLC and storing it in the
Synnax database. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a read task.

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the task, you'll need to have connected to an OPC UA server 
and created the relevant channels in the Synnax database. Check out [Connect to an OPC UA Server](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/connect-server)
for information on how to do this.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with devices in Synnax. Tasks can be used
for both control and data acqusition purposes. In the context of OPC UA, a read task defines
a background process that reads data from your server at a specified sampling rate.

An OPC UA read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We permanently
store the configuration of the task in the Synnax Database, so it's easy to set up multiple
tasks for different purposes.

## Important Rules for Read Tasks

There are a few important concepts to keep in mind when configuring a read task.

### Sample Rates & Timing

All channels in a read task are sampled at the same rate. If you'd like to sample 
different channels at different rates, create a separate task to do so. 

Synnax uses software timing to read from your PLC, and typically delivers precision
on the order of 100 microseconds. Under heavy load, this timing precision may degrade.

For low rate, sub 200Hz tasks where timing is not critical, we recommend letting Synnax
automatically determine the timestamps for index channels (for more information, see
[correctly configuring indexes](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/connect-server#correctly-configure-indexes)).

For high-precision tasks, we recommend reading timestamps from the PLC. More info on 
this [here](http://localhost:4321/reference/device-drivers/opcua/read-task#adding-index-channels)

For high rate, above 500Hz tasks, we also recommend sampling in [array mode], where 
Synnax will read samples in bulk from the PLC. Array mode is more challengin to configure,
but can be far more efficient.

### One Running Task Per Channel

Synnax can only accept live data from a channel from one source at a time. If you have
a task running that reads from a `pressure` channel, you cannot create another task that
reads from the same channel.

### One Running Task Per Index Channel

[Index channels](/reference/concepts/channels#channel-types) are useed to store the 
timestamps for your data channels. When you configure a task to read from a data channel,
Synnax will automatically generate timestamps for the corresponding index channel, 
regardless of whether you've explicitly added it to the task.

For example, imaging we two channels, `pressure` and `temperature` that share the same
index channel, `time`. If you configure a task to read from `pressure`, Synnax will
automatically generate timestamps for the `time` channel. If you then configure a task
to read from `temperature`, Synnax will not allow you to start the task, as the `time`
channel is already in use.

## Configuring the Task - Default Sampling

To configure a read task, open the Synnax Console and click on the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. 
You can also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "OPC UA".
You'll see an option called "Create a New Read Task". Select this option to open the read task
configuration dialog.

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}> Select your OPC UA Device</StepText>

The first step is to select the OPC UA server you'd like to collect data from. Use the
dropdown menu in the top left corner to do so.

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

Next, you'll need to add channels to the task. These channels define a mapping between
the OPC UA node you'd like to read from, and the corresponding Synnax channel you'd like
to store the data in.

To add a channel, click on the "+" button in the channels section. Then, click on the new
channel and select the OPC UA node you'd like to read from. Finally, select the Synnax
channel you'd like to store the data in. Note that the Synnax channel doesn't need to
be the same as the channel you created when configuring the server.

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Adding Index Channels</StepText>

If the index channel for your corresponding data channels is not in the task, Synnax
will automatically generate timestamps forf the data channels. If you'd like to read
timestamps from the PLC, add the index channel to the task and select the corresponding
PLC node.

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Configure Timing</StepText>

There are two parameters to control the timing of the task: the sample rate and the 
stream rate. The sample rate defines how often Synnax will poll the OPC UA server for
new data, while the stream rate defines how often the task will Stream data into the 
Synnax database.

For example, if you set the sample rate to 10hz and the stream rate to 1hz. Synnax will
poll the OPC UA server every 100ms, collect 10 samples, and then forward these samples
to the server. 

For very low rate tasks (sub 50Hz), we recommend setting the stream rate to the same
value as the sample rate. For higher rate tasks, lowering the stream rate can significantly
improve performance. It's typically best ot keep the stream rate below 50Hz unless you
need to quickly process incoming data in real-time.

### <StepText level="h3" step={5}>Configure and Start the Task</StepText>

Once you'd added all the channels you need, click the "Configure" button. If there are
no errors, the Synnax database will acknowledge the configured task and enable the "Play"
button in the dialog.

At this point, feel free to close the dialog. Your task will continue to run in the 
background until you re-open the window to stop it.

## Configuring the Task - Array Sampling

Array sampling is a more advanced method of reading data from an OPC UA server, and is
typically only necessary for very high rate tasks (above 500Hz). Instead of reading single
samples from the server, Synnax will read many samples in bulk. Array sampling requires
a little bit of tuning to set up, and here's how you can do it.

<Note variant="info">
When experimenting with array based sampling, we recommend running a [separate](http://localhost:4321/reference/cluster/quick-start?platform=linux) Synnax 
database with a memory-backed data store. This will allow you to quickly test 
different configurations without writing a large amount of experimental data to your 
production database.

### <StepText level="h3" step={1}>Make sure your PLC is correctly configured</StepText>

Make sure your PLC is correctly configured to read data in arrays. For information on
how to do this, see [considerations for high data rates](device-drivers/opcua/connect-server#considerations-for-high-data-rates).

### <StepText level="h3" step={2}>Enable Array Sampling</StepText>

To enable array sampling mode for a task, toggle the "Array Sampling" switch in the
top left corner. This will alter the "Stream Rate" field to display an "Array Size"
field instead.

**Set the array size to the same length as the arrays you'll be reading from the PLC.** 

### <StepText level="h3" step={3}>Add Channels to the Task</StepText>

In array mode, you'll only be able to add PLC nodes that are array-based. Otherwise,
the process is the same as for default sampling.

### <StepText level="h3" step={4}>Configure Index Channels</StepText>

For high data rates, we recommend reading timestamps from the PLC instead of having
Synnax generate them. To do this, add the index channel for any of your data channels
to the task, and select the corresponding PLC node that contains the timestamps.

### <StepText level="h3" step={5}>Timing</StepText>

Running a task with array sampling enabled can result in both **oversampling** and
**undersampling**. Oversampling occurs when the PLC doesn't completely replace all
values in the array before Synnax reads it. Undersampling can occur when the PLC
is re-writing the array faster than Synnax can read it. 

We recommend setting the sampling rate to the **same** sampling rate as the PLC. For
extremely high data rates, under and oversampling by a few samples in the array can
occur under normal operating conditions. This typically isn't a problem. If you're 
concerned about this, [let us know](https://www.synnaxlabs.com/contact).

### <StepText level="h3" step={6}>Configure and Start the Task</StepText>

Once you've added all the channels you need, click the "Configure" button. If there are
no errors, the Synnax database will acknowledge the configured task and enable the "Play"
button in the dialog.
