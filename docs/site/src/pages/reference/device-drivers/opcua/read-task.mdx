Setting up a read task is the primary method for acquiring data from a PLC and storing
it in the Synnax database. In this guide, we'll walk you through the read task setup process.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can configure a read task, you'll need to have connected to an OPC UA server 
and created the relevant channels in the Synnax database. If you haven't done this yet,
check out the [Connect to an OPC UA Server](/reference/device-drivers/opcua/connect-server)
guide.

## A Short Primer on Tasks

Tasks are the primary method for communicating with devices in Synnax. Tasks can be used
for both control and data acqusition purposes. In the context of OPC UA, a read task defines
a background process that reads data from your server at a specified sampling rate.

An OPC UA read task can be started, stopped, and re-configured at any time. We permanently
store the configuration of the task in the Synnax Database, so it's easy to set up multiple
tasks for different purposes.

## Configuring a Read Task

To configure a read task, open the Synnax Console and click on the Quick Search & Command Palette at the top. 
You can also open this palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.

In command mode (enabled when the first character in the input is ">"), type "OPC UA".
You'll see an option called "Create a New Read Task". Select this option to open the read task
configuration dialog.

### Step 1 - Select your OPC UA Device and Configure Sampling Rates

The selectin dialog in the top left allows you to choose the OPC UA server you'd like to 
collect data from. Select your device, and then configure the sampling rate for the task
in the dialog to the right.

### Step 2 - Add Channels to the Task

Next, you'll need to add channels to the task. These channels define a mapping between the
OPC UA node you'd like to read from, and the corresponding Synnax channel you'd like to store
the data in. 

To add a channel, click on the "+" button in the channels section. Then, click on the new
channel and select the OPC UA node you'd like to read from. Finally, select the Synnax 
channel you'd like to store the data in. Note that the Synnax channel doesn't need to 
be the same as the channel you created when configuring the server.

### Step 3 - Configure and Start the Task

Once you'd added all the channels you need, click the "Configure" button. If your task
is configured correctly, the Synnax database will acknowledge the configured task and 
enable the "Play" button. Click this button to start the task.

At this point, feel free to close the dialog. Your task will continue to run in the 
background until you re-open the dialog and stop it.
