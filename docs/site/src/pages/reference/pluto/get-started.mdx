Powering the inner workings of the [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started), 
Pluto is a [React](https://react.dev/) component library designed to build high-performance, 
real-time interfaces on top of Synnax. It provides a number of components from simple 
buttons to complex data visualizations.

<Note variant="warning">
Pluto is currently in beta and it's API is subject to significant changes before 
reaching V1.

## Installation

Pluto is available on npm, and can be installed with your package manager of choice. We'll
be using `npm` in our documentation, but feel free to use `yarn`, `pnpm`, or any other
package manager you prefer.

```bash
npm install @synnaxlabs/pluto
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites and Important Notes

Pluto is designed for high performance and flexibility, and this has come across at the
cost of ease of use. We're working hard to improve user friendliness!

### Browser Compatibility

Pluto heavily leverages **Web Workers** and the `OffscreenCanvas` API. These features are
generally available on the latest versions of all major browsers, but may not be 
compatible with older versions. 

See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas#browser_compatibility)
for the `OffscreenCanvas` compatibility table.

### Bundle Size and Import Structure

Pluto is relatively large(~500kb minified and gzipped). As a result, We don't recommend 
deploying applications that use Pluto in serverless environments or when building 
applications designed to serve users with a slow bandwidth.

The component library is designed to be tree-shakeable, so you can import only the
components you need. For example, when importing a `Button` component, you can do:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";
```

instead of importing the entire library:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";
```

### Strict Mode Incompatibility

Pluto uses several mechanisms to manage communication between the main thread and the
Web Worker. These mechanisms are not yet compatible with React's strict mode. If you
do use strict mode, you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior.

### Components as Modules

When you import the `Button` above, you're not actually importing the `Button` component 
itself. Instead, you're importing a module that exports the `Button`, along
with other useful utilities. With almost every component in Pluto, you'll see a syntax
resembling the following:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";

const regularButton = <Button.Button>Click me!</Button.Button>;
const onlyIconButton = <Button.Icon>ðŸš€</Button.Icon>;
```

This syntax just means we're accessing the `Button` or the `Icon` component from the
`Button` module. We like this syntax as it adds clarity to the codebase. Some of our
users don't like it. To get around this, you can destruct the module:

```typescript
import { Button as PButton } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";
const { Button, Icon: IconButton } = PButton;

const regularButton = <Button>Click me!</Button>;
const onlyIconButton = <IconButton>ðŸš€</IconButton>;
```
