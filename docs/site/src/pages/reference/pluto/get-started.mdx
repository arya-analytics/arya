Powering the inner workings of the [Synnax Console](/reference/console/get-started), 
Pluto is a [React](https://react.dev/) component library designed to build high-performance, 
real-time user interfaces on top of Synnax. It provides a number of components from simple 
buttons to complex data visualizations.

<Note variant="warning">
Pluto is currently in beta and it's API is subject to changes before reaching V1.

## Installation

Pluto is available on npm, and can be installed with your package manager of choice. We'll
be using `npm` in our documentation, but feel free to use `yarn`, `pnpm`, or any other
package manager you prefer.

```bash
npm install @synnaxlabs/pluto
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Prerequisites and Important Notes

Pluto is designed for high performance and flexibility, which comes at the
cost of ease of use. We're working hard to improve user friendliness!

### Browser Compatibility

Pluto leverages **Web Workers** and the `OffscreenCanvas` API. These features are
generally available on the latest versions of all major browsers, but may not be 
compatible with older versions. 

See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas#browser_compatibility)
for the `OffscreenCanvas` compatibility table.

### Bundle Size and Import Structure

Pluto is relatively large  around ~500kb minified and gzipped. We don't recommend deploying 
applications that use Pluto in serverless environments or when building interfaces 
designed to serve users with a slow network.

The component library is designed to be tree-shakeable, so you can import only the
components you need. For example, when importing a `Button` component, you can do:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";
```

instead of importing the entire library:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto";
```

### Strict Mode Incompatibility

Pluto uses several mechanisms to manage communication between the main thread and the
Web Worker. These mechanisms are not yet compatible with React's strict mode. If you
do use strict mode, you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior.

### Components as Modules

When you import the `Button` above, you're not actually importing the `Button` component 
itself. Instead, you're importing a module that exports the `Button`, along
with other useful utilities. You'll see this Syntax with almost every component in Pluto:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";

const regularButton = <Button.Button>Click me!</Button.Button>;
const onlyIconButton = <Button.Icon>ðŸš€</Button.Icon>;
```

We're accessing the `Button` or the `Icon` component from the `Button` module. We like 
this syntax as it adds clarity to the codebase. Some of our users don't like it. If you
prefer to access the components directly, we recommend destructuring the module:

```typescript
import { Button as PButton } from "@synnaxlabs/pluto/button";
const { Button, Icon: IconButton } = PButton;

const regularButton = <Button>Click me!</Button>;
const onlyIconButton = <IconButton>ðŸš€</IconButton>;
```
