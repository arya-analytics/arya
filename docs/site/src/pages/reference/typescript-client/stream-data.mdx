Streaming data is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and
monitoring. This page guides you through using the TypeScript client to stream
data from a Synnax cluster. If you'd like a conceptual overview of how streams work in
Synnax, check out the [streams](/reference/concepts/streams) page.

## Open a Streamer

To start streaming data, call the `openStreamer` method on the client and
provide a list of channels to stream:

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
```

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Reading Frames

Then, to read the next incoming data frame, call the `read` method on the streamer:

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
```

This call will block until a new frame is available. **This frame may not
contain data for every channel specified**. For example, if we're reading from
two sensors that are being sampled by different devices at different rates, we
may receive a frame containing data only for the first channel, followed by a
frame containing data only for the second channel.

For more details on how to work with the returned frames, see the [Series and Frames](series-and-frames) page.

### Downsampling Frames

If you are interested in streaming data at a lower rate than is being written to the server, you can use the optional `downsample` parameter to specify the number of frames to skip before returning the next frame:

```typescript
// setting the downsample factor to n means every nth sample will be retained
// e.g. for a downsample factor of 2, if [0.13, 0.12, 0.14, 0.13] is written,
// a streamer.read() will return [0.13, 0.14]

const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"], 2);
```

### Handling Partial Frames

When reading frames from a streamer, it's important to note that a frame may not
contain data for every channel specified when opening the streamer. For example,
if we're reading from two sensors, `temperature` and `pressure`, that are being
sampled by different devices at different rates, we may receive a frame
containing data only for the first channel, followed by a frame containing only
data for the second channel.

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
console.log(frame.at(-1));
// Output: { temperature: 25.0 }
const frame2 = await streamer.read();
console.log(frame2.at(-1));
// Output: { pressure: 1000.0 }
const frame3 = await streamer.read();
console.log(frame3.at(-1));
// Output: { temperature: 25.0, pressure: 1000.0 }
```

To check if a frame contains data for a specific channel, you can use the `has`
method:

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
if (frame.has("temperature")) console.log(frame.get("temperature"));
```

### Using an Async For Loop

The streamer implements an async iterator, which can be useful for continuously
processing incoming frames of data:

```typescript
for await (const frame of streamer) {
  // Process the frame
  const latestSamples = frame.at(-1);
}
```

## Updating the Channel List

If you need to update the list of channels being streamed, you can call the
`update` method on the streamer:

```typescript
await streamer.update(["temperature1", "temperature2", "pressure"]);
```

<Note.Note variant="info">
  This method will *replace* the current list of channels with the new list, not add to
  it.
</Note.Note>

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Closing the Streamer

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on
the streamer to release the network connection and other related resources:

```typescript
streamer.close();
```

We recommend using the `streamer` object within a `try-finally` block when possible. This
ensures that the streamer is always closed, even if an exception is thrown:

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
try {
  for await (const frame of streamer) {
    // Process the frame
  }
} finally {
  streamer.close();
}
```
