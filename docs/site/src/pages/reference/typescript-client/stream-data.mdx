Streaming data is useful for real-time processing, visualization, and monitoring.
This page guides you through using the TypeScript client to stream data from a 
Synnax cluster.

## Open a Streamer

To start streaming data, call the `telem.openStreamer` method on the client and provide
a list of channels to stream.

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
```

## Reading Frames

Then, to read the next incoming data frame, call the `read` method on the streamer.

```typescript
const frame = await streamer.read();
```

This call will block until a new frame is available. **This frame may not contain data
for every channel specified**. For example, if we're reading from two sensors that
are being sampled by different devices at different rates, we may receive a frame
containing data only for the first channel, followed by a frame containing data only
for the second channel.

For more details on how to work with the returned frames, see the [Series and Frames](series-and-frames) page.

### Using an Async For Loop

The streamer implements an async iterator, which can be useful for continuously 
processing incoming frames of data.

```typescript
for await (const frame of streamer) {
  // Process the frame
  const latestSamples = frame.at(-1);
}
```

## Closing the Streamer

After you're done streaming, it's essential that you call the `close` method on the
streamer to release the network connection and other related resources. 

```typescript
streamer.close();
```

We recommend using the `streamer` object within a `try-finally` block when possible. This
ensures that the streamer is always closed, even if an exception is thrown.

```typescript
const streamer = await client.openStreamer(["temperature1", "temperature2"]);
try {
  for await (const frame of streamer) {
    // Process the frame
  }
} finally {
  streamer.close();
}
```
