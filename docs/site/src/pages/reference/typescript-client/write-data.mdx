The Synnax TypeScript client supports multiple methods for writing data to a
cluster. We can write directly to a channel, or we can write to multiple
channels in a streaming fashion using a writer.

## Writing to a Channel

Writing to a channel requires us to write timestamps to it's index channel
before we write the data. We'll create the following channels to use as
examples:

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const temperatureChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "temperature",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeChannel.key
});
```

Then, we'll make sure to write timestamps to the index before we write to the data channel:

```typescript

import { TimeStamp, TimeSpan } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const start = TimeStamp.now();
const timestamps = new BigInt64Array([
    start.bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(1)).bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(2)).bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(3)).bigInt,
    start.add(TimeSpan.seconds(4)).bigInt
]);
const temperatures = new Float32Array([20.0, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4]);

// Write the timestamps to the index first
await timeChannel.write(start, timestamps);
// Then write the data
await temperatureChannel.write(start, temperatures);
```

Notice how we align the two arrays by using the common `start` timestamp. This
tells Synnax that the first sample in the `temperatures` array is associated
with the first timestamp in the `timestamps` array, and so on.

Synnax will raise a `ValidationError` if the index does not contain a
corresponding timestamp for every sample in the data array. After all, it
wouldn't make sense to have a temperature reading without an associated
timestamp.

## Using a Writer

While the above methods are great for writing static, existing data, it's common
to want to write data in a streaming fashion for use in control sequences and
live dashboards. The `Writer` class is designed to handle this use case (and is
actually used under the hood by the above methods).

Writers are a bit more complicated to operate, so we recommend reading the
[concepts](../concepts/write#transactions) page to learn more about how
they work.

### Opening a Writer

We'll create the following index-indexed pair to use with our writer:

```typescript
import { DataType } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const timeChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const temperatureChannel = await client.channels.create({
    name: "temperature",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeChannel.key
});
```

Then, we'll open a writer for both of these channels by using the `openWriter`
method on the client:

```typescript
import { TimeStamp, Series, Frame } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const writer = await client.openWriter({
    start: TimeStamp.now(),
    channels: [timeChannel.key, temperatureChannel.key],
});

try {
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        await writer.write(new Frame({
            [timeChannel.key]: TimeStamp.now(),
            [temperatureChannel.key]: 20.0 + i,
        }));
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    }
    await writer.commit():
} finally {
    await writer.close()
}
```

This example will write 100 samples to the `temperature` channel, each roughly
100ms apart, and will commit all writes when finished.

It's typical to write and commit millions of samples over the course of hours or
days, intermittently calling commit to ensure that the data is safely stored in
the cluster.

Alternatively, you could initiate with auto-commit enabled by passing in the
configuration argument `enableAutoCommit: true`. When auto-commit is enabled, a
writer will effectuate a commit after every write, automatically saving the data
to the database.

It's very important to free the writer resources when finished by calling the
`close` method. If `close` is not called at the end of the writer, other writers
may not be able to write to the same channels. We typically recommend placing
the writer operations inside a try-finally block to ensure that the writer is
always closed.
