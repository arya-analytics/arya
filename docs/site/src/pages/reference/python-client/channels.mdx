The Python client provides interfaces for creating, retrieving, and deleting
channels. We'll cover the details of each of these operations in this guide.

If you're unfamiliar with what channels are and how they work, check out the
[channels concepts guide](../concepts/channels).

## Creating Channels

We can create channels using the `channels.create` method on the client.

### Creating a Data Channel and its Index 

Creating a data channel first requires us to create an index channel to store
its timestamps.

```python
# Create a time channel to store the timestamps of our data channel
time_index_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    # Index channels must have a data type of TIMESTAMP and is_index 
    # set to True
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP, 
    is_index=True,
)

# Create a data channel that stores 32-bit floats
my_sensor = client.channels.create(
    name="my_sensor",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=time_index_channel.key, # Pass the key of the index channel here.
)
```

### Creating Multiple Channels

We can create multiple channels by passing a list to the `create` method. This
is more efficient than creating many channels individually, and provides the
atomic guarantee that either all or no channels will be created.

Keep in mind that we need to create index channels before we can create the
channels that use them. We're working on adding functionality to the client that
will allow us to create all of these channels in a single call.

```python
import numpy as np

# We need to create the index first, that way we can provide the index
# key to our data channels.
time_index = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=True,
)

sensor_one = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_one",
    data_type=np.float32, # You can use numpy to define data types
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_two = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_two",
    data_type="float32" # Or you can use strings
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_three = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor_three",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32, # Or you can use Synnax data types
    index=time_index.key,
)

client.channels.create([
    sensor_one,
    sensor_two,
    sensor_three,
])
```

### Only Create a Channel if it Doesn't Exist

There are situations where we want to ensure that a channel with a particular
name exists, but don't want it duplicated if it has already been created. To 
accomplish this, we can use the `retrieve_if_name_exists` flag.

```python
# Create a channel if it doesn't exist
my_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="my_channel",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=my_index.key,
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

This also works when creating multiple channels.

```python
# Create multiple channels if they don't exist
my_channels = client.channels.create(
    [my_channel_one, my_channel_two, my_channel_three],
    retrieve_if_name_exists=True,
)
```

## Retrieving Channels

We can retrieve channels using the `channels.retrieve` method.

### Retrieving a Single Channel

To retrieve a single channel, pass the channel's name or key to the `retrieve`
method.

```python
# By name
my_sensor = client.channels.retrieve("my_sensor")
# If you know the key, you can also retrieve by key
my_sensor = client.channels.retrieve(my_sensor.key)
```

The client will raise a `NotFoundError` if no channels match the query, and a
`MultipleFoundError` if more than one channel matches the query. If you'd like
to accept no or multiple results, provide a list to the `retrieve` method as
shown in the next section.

<Note variant="info">
Retrieving by key is more efficient than by name, and we recommend doing so when
possible.
</Note>

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

To retrieve multiple channels, pass a list of names or a list of keys to the
`retrieve` method.

```python
# By name
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"])
# By key if you know them
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key])
# This won't work!
my_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["sensor_one", sensor_two.key])
```

Note that Synnax will not raise a `NotFoundError` if it cannot find a channel
matching a key or name. Instead, the missing channel will simply be omitted from
the list of results.

### Retrieving a Channel Using a Range

If you've queried a [range](ranges), you can access channels as properties. If
the channel name is not a valid Python identifier, you can use the dictionary
accessor (`[]`) instead.

```python
# Retrieve the range - see the highlighted link above for how these work
test_one = client.ranges.retrieve("02/22/23 Testing")

# Grab a channel
ch = test_one["sensor_one"]
# Or like this
ch = test_one.sensor_one
```

<Note variant="info">
When using a range, it's possible to retrieve a channel by it's alias instead of
its name. For more information, see <a href="ranges#aliasing-channels">aliasing channels</a>.
</Note>

### Retrieving Channels Using Regular Expressions

If you're familiar with regular expressions, you can use them to retrieve
channels that match a pattern. For example, if we wanted to retrieve all
channels that start with "sensor", we could do the following:

```python
sensor_channels = client.channels.retrieve(["^sensor"])
```

It's important to note that if we're expecting multiple channels to match our
pattern, we need to pass in a list to the `retrieve` method, otherwise the
client will raise a `MultipleFoundError`.

## Deleting Channels

<Note variant="warning">
Deleting a channel will also delete all of the data stored in that channel. This
is a permanent operation that cannot be undone. Be careful!
</Note>

To delete a channel, we can use the `channels.delete` method.

```python
# Delete a single channel
client.channels.delete("my_sensor")
# Delete multiple channels
client.channels.delete(["sensor_one", "sensor_two"])
# Delete by key
client.channels.delete(sensor_three.key)
# Delete many by key
client.channels.delete([sensor_one.key, sensor_two.key, sensor_three.key])
```

Unlike with retrieving channels, Synnax will not raise an error if it cannot
find a channel matching the key or name. This means that `delete` is an
idempotent operation, and is safe to call even if the channel has already been
deleted.

Deleting a channel by name will delete **all** channels with that name.

## Next Steps

Now that we know how to create and retrieve channels, we can start reading and
writing data to them. Check out the [reading data](read-data) and [writing
data](write-data) guides to learn more.
