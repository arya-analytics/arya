This page walks you through the lifecycle of a write to a cluster. If you'd like
a practical guide on reading data using a client library, look at the respective
pages for [Python](../python-client/write-data) and
[TypeScript](../typescript-client/write-data).

## Transactions

The transaction lifecycle is controlled by a writer. To begin a transaction, a
caller opens a new writer and then begins writing data frames using a file like
interface. After they're done writing, the user commits the write to the
database, making it available for reading. Synnax transactions are unique in
that they can be committed **multiple** times, where each new commit extends the
data written in the previous commit. After the final commit, the user closes the
writer, at which point the cluster releases all write related resources and the
domain can no longer be extended.

### Open Phase

To start a new transaction, a user must specify two properties:

1. The channels they wish to write to.
2. The timestamp marking the start of the new domain.

In addition, the writer is configured with Auto-Commit (see Commit Phase) off
by default, a user may specify it to be on in this phase.

Using this information, the database validates the following:

1. That all channels exist in the database.
2. That no existing domain overlaps with the provided timestamp. If any domains
   overlap, the new domain is invalid and cannot be committed.
3. That all channels share the same rate or index.

### Write Phase

After all validation checks pass, the transaction enters the write phase. During
this period, a user can write continuous frames of data to the domain. These
frames must be vertical (i.e. all channels must have a single array specified),
and all arrays must have the same number of samples. You can read more about
frame alignment here.

These frames are assumed to be continuous by the database. To illustrate this,
imagine we write the following frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.17         | 344.78          | 16.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.18         | 346.78          | 17.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.19         | 348.78          | 18.22                  |

After this write, our database looks exactly like our first frame. Then we write
the next frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.21         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.22         | 352.78          | 20.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.23         | 354.78          | 21.22                  |

Now, our database looks like this:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.17         | 344.78          | 16.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.18         | 346.78          | 17.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.19         | 348.78          | 18.22                  |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.21         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.22         | 352.78          | 20.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.23         | 354.78          | 21.22                  |

Throughout the write phase, we can continue extending our database by adding
frames.

### Commit Phase

Once we're ready to persist the transaction and make it available for reads, we
commit our writer. During this phase, the cluster identifies the time range of
the writer based on the provided starting timestamp and the samples written. The
commit process succeeds and the write is now available for reads. After this
phase completes, the transaction is moved back into the write phase. At this
point, we can either write more frames to the cluster and commit again, or we
can close the writer.

Alternatively, if you configured your writer to Auto-Commit mode, a Commit Phase
automatically follows every Write phase, rendering the data immediately available as
it is written. Each commit extends the data from the previous commit.

### Close Phase

Once done writing, the user can close the writer and release all of it's
resources. All uncomitted writes will be lost.
