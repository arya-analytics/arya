Synnax is a streaming time-series database designed to acquire, store, and transmit
real-time data from hardware systems. It scales horizontally, and can be deployed on
edge services for data acquisition or in cloud environments for high-performance
analysis.

Synnax inherits a hybrid pedigree from hardware data acquisition (DAQ) systems and
cloud-native, horizontally scalable databases. This page introduces the core concepts
needed to effectively integrate a Synnax cluster into your systems.

## Distribution Components

### Nodes

A [node](/reference/concepts/clusters-and-nodes#what-is-a-node) is an individual,
running instance of the [Synnax executable](/reference/cluster/quick-start). The host
machine can be an edge device, VM, container, or bare metal server. The only requirement
is that it can store data on disk and has an address reachable by other nodes in the
cluster.

### Clusters

Nodes communicate with each other to form a
[cluster](/reference/concepts/clusters-and-nodes#what-is-a-cluster). The nodes in a
cluster collaborate to read, write, and exchange data. Nodes expose the cluster as a
monolothic data space, meaning that a user can query a single node for the entire
clusterâ€™s data without being aware of where it is actually stored.

## Data Components

The data components of a cluster are the building blocks for storing, retrieving, and
streaming hardware telemetry data. There are five data components. We'll step
through each one.

### Samples

A sample is a single value recorded at a specific point in time. When dealing with 
hardware, samples are most commonly numeric sensor readings, such as temperature or
pressure. Samples can also be actuator commands, status codes, or any other strongly
typed value.

### Channels

A [channel](/reference/concepts/channels) is a logical collection of samples emitted by
or representing the values of a single source. This source is typically a sensor, although
channels can also hold values like actuator commands, status codes, log messages, or 
enumerations.

In Synnax, samples written to a channel are both stored permanently and streamed in 
real-time. Live transmission allows for consumers (called [streamers](/reference/concepts/streams)) 
to receive and process real-time data. Common use cases for data streaming include 
visualization, anomaly detection, and automated control.

Combined data storage and streaming is a key feature of Synnax, enabling many powerful
workflows that would otherwise require multiple systems to implement.

### Ranges

A [range](/reference/concepts/reads#what-is-a-range) (short for _time range_) is a
user-defined time interval that labels interesting events in your data. While channels
are used to group samples by source, ranges are used to group related samples by time
period.

In addition to being the primary method for querying data from a cluster, Ranges are also
a powerful tool for attaching crucial meta-data to telemetry values.

In a test operations context, ranges can be used to label specific test runs, attaching
information like calibration data, test parameters, and procedures. In manufacturing
and monitoring, ranges can be used to label anomalies, identify maintenance periods, or
annotate automated control actions.

### Series

While channels and ranges group related data, series do the heavy lifting in terms
of storing and transmitting actual samples. A series is comparable to a list or array
in other programming languages. When reading or writing data to Synnax, you'll frequently
work with channel data as a collection of one or more series.

### Frames

A frame is a collection of related series. These series form a table-like structure
comparable to a pandas `DataFrame` in Python or a `data.frame` in R. Each column holds
one or more series. Frames are the fundamental unit of data transfer within Synnax, and
are very useful for effectively working with data from multiple channels at once.

## Operation Components

The operation components are key interfaces that allows users to access and modify the
samples in a cluster.

### Writers

[Writers](/reference/concepts/writes) are used to write samples to a cluster. They can
be used to write static data in large batches or stream data in real-time. A writer can
be opened on multiple channels, where each frame contains series with samples for each
channel. Writers support atomic transactions, meaning that all samples in a frame are
written to the cluster or none are. This is particularly useful when reading in data
from large files.

Writers also support dynamic control handoff, which is when multiple writers can be
opened on the same channel, but only a subset (typically one) of the writers is actually
allowed to write to the channel at any given time. This is useful for transitioning
control between manual operators and automated systems.

### Iterators / Readers

The primary method for reading data from a cluster is through an
[iterator](/reference/concepts/reads). Iterators read data in a streaming fashion,
allowing users to efficiently query and process large quantities of data. They can be
opened on one or more channels to read historical data across a specific range of time.
Iterators are sometimes called "readers".

### Streamers

[Streamers](/reference/concepts/streams) are used to stream data in real-time. They can
be thought of as a 'subscriber' in a traditional publish-subscribe system. Like
iterators, streamers can be opened on one or more channels to receive data as it is
being written. Streamers are useful for live plotting, control, and real-time post
processing.

### Deletes

Deletes are used to remove samples from a cluster.

## Synnax as a Spreadsheet

A Synnax cluster's data can be though of as a very large, distributed spreadsheet. Each
channel is a column and each row contains several samples.

This table describes the data layout for our cyclist's rides. Each individual channel,
such as speed-gps or speed-target, is a series. The collection of series indexed to one
time series is a frame.
