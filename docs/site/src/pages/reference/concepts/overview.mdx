Synnax is a streaming time-series database designed to acquire, store, and transmit
real-time data from hardware systems. It scales horizontally, and can be deployed
on edge services for data acquisition or in cloud environments for high-performance
analysis.

Synnax inherits a hybrid pedigree from hardware data acquisition (DAQ) systems and
cloud-native, horizontally scalable databases. This page introduces the core concepts
needed to effectively integrate a Synnax cluster into your systems.

## Distribution Components

### Nodes

A [node](clusters-and-nodes#what-is-a-node) is an individual, running instance of the 
[Synnax executable](/cluster/quick-start). The host machine can be an edge device, VM, 
container, or bare metal server. The only requirement is that it can store data on disk and 
has an address reachable by other nodes in the cluster.

### Clusters

Nodes communicate with each other to form a [cluster](clusters-and-nodes#what-is-a-cluster).
The nodes in a cluster collaborate to read, write, and exchange data. Nodes
expose the cluster as a monolothic data space, meaning that a user can query a
single node for the entire cluster’s data without being aware of where it is
actually stored.

## Data Components

Now that we’ve covered the basic distributed systems terminology, we’re ready to
step into the data components in a cluster.

To illustrate how these components work together, we’ll use the example of a
cyclist who takes several two-hour rides over the course of a month. During each
ride, they use a speedometer to record their instantaneous speed once per
second.

### Samples

A sample is a strongly typed value recorded at a specific point in time. The
readings from our cyclicts’s speedometer are reported as `float32` values in
kilometers per hour.

### Channels

A [channel](channels) is a logical collection of samples emitted by or
representing the values of a single source (typically a sensor or actuator). We can 
store the speedometer readings across all the cyclists’s rides in a single channel 
titled “speed-gps”. We can also create channels that store post-processed results 
or simulated values. For example, we can record target speeds for each ride in a
“speed-target” channel, and then write the difference between our target and
actual readings in a “speed-diff” channel. As long as the samples are
time-ordered, do not have duplicates (i.e. no two samples have the same
timestamp), and have a consistent data type, they can be contained in a channel.

Channels can also be used to stream samples in real-time. This is useful for live 
plotting, control sequences, and post-processing applications. 

### Ranges

A [range](read-ranges) (short for "time range"), is a user defined region of a
channel's data. Ranges are purely for categorization and do not affect the structure of 
a channel's data. Ranges can be subsections of a domain or span multiple domains. They 
can also overlap with or contain other ranges. Ranges are typically used to indicate 
important events or categorize long periods of time.

After each ride, we can identify periods of interest, such as hills or descents,
and define ranges to mark them as relevant for analysis. If our cyclist is
training for a century race, we can also wrap all of their rides in a ‘century
training’ range to keep them nicely categorized.

### Series

While ranges virtually separate areas of related data, series are used to hold the 
actual samples. They can be compared to arrays or lists in most programming languages.
Series are strongly typed hold their values in time-order. When writing data to the 
cluster, a user must provide a [frame](#frames) containing an series of samples for each 
channel they wish to write to. When reading data, a caller typically receives frames
containing series of samples for each channel across the requested period of time.

### Frames

A frame is a collection of related series. These series form a table like
structure comparable to a pandas `DataFrame` in Python or a `data.frame` in R.
Each column holds a one or more series. They're the fundamental unit of data
transfer within a cluster, and are used for reads, writes, and streaming.

## Operation Components

The operation components are key interfaces that allows users to access and modify the
samples in a cluster.

### Writers 

[Writers] are used to write samples to a cluster. They can be used to write static data
in large batches or stream data in real-time. A writer can be opened on multiple 
channels, where each frame contains series with samples for each channel. Writers support
atomic transactions, meaning that all samples in a frame are written to the cluster or
none are. This is particularly useful when reading in data from large files.

Writers also support dynamic control handoff i.e. multiple writers can be opened on the 
same channel, but only a subset (typically one) of the writers is actually allowed to 
write to the channel at any given time. This is useful for transitioning control between 
manual operators and automated systems.

### Iterators/Readers

The primary method for reading data from a cluster is through an [iterator]. Iterators
read data in a streaming fashion, allowing users to efficiently query and process large
quantities of data. They can be opened on one or more channels to read historical data
across a specific range of time.

### Streamers

[Streamers] are used to stream data in real-time. They can be thought of as a 'subscriber'
in a traditional publish-subscribe system. Like iterators, streamers can be opened on one
or more channels to receive data as it is being written. Streamers are useful for live
plotting, control, and real-time post processing.

### Deletes

Deletes are used to remove samples from a cluster. 

## Synnax as a Spreadsheet

A Synnax cluster's data can be though of as a very large, distributed
spreadsheet. Each channel is a column and each row contains several samples.

This table describes the data layout for our cyclist's rides. Each individual
channel, such as speed-gps or speed-target, is a series. The collection of
series indexed to one time series is a frame.
