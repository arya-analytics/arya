A Range (short for _time range_) is a named time interval that labels interesting
events in your cluster's data. While simple in nature, ranges are a remarkably
powerful tool for organizing and sharing data across your team.

To create a range, you only need to specify a name, a starting timestamp, and an ending 
timestamp. While a range can be used to query the data within a channel, it is not 
necessary to specify the channels that belong within a range.

## Metadata

Ranges can store arbitrary pieces of meta-data that describes important information about
the events that occurred within that range. Common examples include part numbers, links
to procedures, and configuration information. 

The metadata on a range is organized as key-value pairs, where they key is an arbitrary
piece of text (a string), and the value is a link, number, or other data point. 

We generally recommend against storing large blobs of information as meta-data 
(e.g. a configuration file larger than 250KB), as this can have a negative impact on 
performance. Instead, consider storing a link to the configuration file in a cloud storage
service or git repository.

## Channel Aliases

Sometimes you want to refer to a channel by a different name within the scope of 
a range. For example, imagine you're connecting to a device with three analog input voltage
channels: `ai_0`, `ai_1`, and `ai_2`. For an experiment where you're using the first input
to measure pressure in a tank, you might want to refer to the channel as `tank_pressure`.
For a second experiment, you may have the first analog input measuring temperature,
and you'd want to refer to the channel as `temperature`.

_Aliases_ let you configure range-specific names for channels. When you query data 
within a range, you can search for the channel by both its original name and its alias.

## Child Ranges

Child ranges can be used to further segment a range into small, specific intervals.
If you have a range that tracks a series of tests for a single component, you can create
a range for all tests (typically called a campaign), and then create child ranges that
identify specific tests within the campaign. 

Child ranges inherit the metadata and channel aliases from their parent range, but can
override them within the scope of the child range.

## Snapshots

Snapshots can be used to capture the configuration of a resource and tie it to a range.
The most relevant example is a snapshot of a data acquisition and/or control [task](/reference/device-drivers).
When you create a snapshot of a task, you're capturing critical information such as calibrations,
scaling values, and mappings to physical ports and lines. The snapshot provides a permanent way
to refer to the configuration of the task at the time the range was created.

You can also create snapshots of other resources, such as [schematics](/reference/console/schematics).

## Labels

<Image id="concepts/ranges/labels-example" client:only="react" themed={false} />

Labels are a simple way to categorize ranges into groups. They can be used to differentiate
the ranges belonging to a specific process (assembly line or test stand), identify the
status of a range (in progress, completed, success, failure), or any other category
relevant to your team.

## Next Steps

There are a number of ways to create, access, and modify ranges within Synnax. For 
programmatic interfaces, see the [Python](/reference/python-client/ranges) and 
[TypeScript](/reference/typescript-client/ranges) client libraries. To manage ranges
via a UI, check out the [Synnax Console](/reference/console/ranges).
