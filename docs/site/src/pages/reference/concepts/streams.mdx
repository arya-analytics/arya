This page walks you through the high level concepts for streaming real-time data from a
Synnax cluster. If you'd like a practical guide on reading data using a client library,
look at the respective pages for [Python](/reference/python-client/read-data) and
[Typescript](/reference/typescript-client/read-data).

## Overview

Streaming data from a Synnax cluster is useful for real-time data processing, live
visualizations, and control sequences. The main interface for streaming data is the
`Streamer` object.

A single streamer can read data from multiple channels at a single time, and only
updates when new data is available. This makes processing both network and local data
streams easy and efficient.

## Streamer

### Opening a Streamer

To open a streamer, you'll need to provide a list of channels that you'd like to stream
data from. The streamer will validate that the channels exists and are readable before
starting the stream.

#### Optional Arguments

There are also a few optional arguments we can provide when opening a writer:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="#persistencestreaming-modes">Mode</a>
      </td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>The persistence/streaming mode of the writer. This can be persist only,
                stream only, or stream + persist.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="#dynamic-control---write-authorities">Authority</a>
      </td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>The authority to set for the writer. This is used for dynamic control
                handoff between multiple writers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Auto-Commit</td>
      {/* prettier-ignore */}
      <td>Whether writes should be immediately committed to the Synnax
            Cluster.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Reading Data

Once the streamer is open, you can read data from the stream using the `read` method.
This will block until _any_ of the channels have new data available, at which point the
method will return a frame with the new data.

The frame returned by the read method will _not_ always contain data from all channels
specified when opening the streamer. It will only contain data from the channels whose
values changed since the last read.

The series in each frame may also have varying lengths, as certain channels may be
receiving samples in batches and/or at different rates.

For example, if you're reading from channel `temp_1` and `temp_2`, the frame returned
may look like this:

```json
{
  "temp_1": [20.0, 21.0, 22.0],
  "temp_2": [30.0, 31.0]
}
```

Or it may look like this:

```json
{
  "temp_2": [30.0, 31.0, 32.0]
}
```

### Updating the Streamer's Channels

It's possible to change the channels that the streamer reads from at any time. This is
useful for dynamically changing the data that you're interested in, such as when a user
selects a new set of channels to load in a plot.

### Closing a Streamer

When you're done receiving data, it's very important ot close the streamer. This
guarantees that all network connections are closed and local resources are freed.
