This page documents the high-level process of writing data to a cluster, including 
transactions, streaming/persistence modes, and dynamic control handoff. This page is a 
theoretical introduction - for practical guides on writing data using a client library,
see the [Python Client](../python-client/write-data) 
and [TypeScript Client](../typescript-client/write-data) guides.

## Introduction

Writers are used to write telemetry samples to a Synnax cluster. A writer is opened on
a set of channels, and typically writes to these channels in a continuous stream over
long periods of time. 

<Divider.Divider direction="x" />

## Transactions

Each writer governs an atomic transaction against the Synnax cluster. To begin a 
transaction, we open a new writer and start writing data frames using a file like 
interface. After we're done writing, we commit the writer to the database, making it
available for reading. Synnax transactions are unique in that they can be committed 
**multiple** times, where each new commit extends the data written in the previous commit. 
After the final commit, the user closes the writer, at which point the cluster releases 
all write related resources and the transaction is complete.

### Open Phase

To start a new transaction, we need to provide the following information.

<Table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Argument</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Channels</td>
         <td>The channels we're interested in writing to.</td>
      </tr> 
      <tr>
         <td>Timestamp</td>
         <td>The timestamp marking the time at or just before the first written sample was recorded.</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</Table>

Synnax will use these arguments to validate a few things before opening the writer:

1. That all channels exist in the Synnax cluster.
2. That no existing data overlaps with the provided timestamp.

#### Optional Arguments

There are also a few optional arguments we can provide when opening a writer:

<Table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Argument</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td><a href="#persistencestreaming-modes">Mode</a></td>
         <td>The persistence/streaming mode of the writer. This can be persist only, stream only, or stream + persist.</td>
      </tr> 
      <tr>
         <td><a href="#dynamic-control---write-authorities">Authority</a></td>
         <td>The authority to set for the writer. This is used for dynamic control handoff between multiple writers.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Auto-Commit</td>
         <td>Whether writes should be immediately committed to the Synnax Cluster.</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</Table>

### Write Phase

After all opening validation checks pass, the transaction enters the write phase. 
During this period, a user can write continuous frames of data to the transaction. These
frames must be vertical (i.e. all channels must have a single series specified),
and all series must have the same number of samples. You can read more about
frame alignment here.

To illustrate how a series of writes would work, imagine we write the following frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.17         | 344.78          | 16.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.18         | 346.78          | 17.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.19         | 348.78          | 18.22                  |

After this write, the stored data in the Synnax database transaction looks exactly like 
the first frame. Then we write the next frame:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.21         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.22         | 352.78          | 20.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.23         | 354.78          | 21.22                  |

Now, our transaction looks like this:

| time                | my-precise-tc | strain-gauge-01 | pressure-transducer-05 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1677433720770863800 | 19.17         | 344.78          | 16.22                  |
| 1677433720970863400 | 19.18         | 346.78          | 17.22                  |
| 1677433721270868900 | 19.19         | 348.78          | 18.22                  |
| 1677433721470863800 | 19.21         | 350.78          | 19.22                  |
| 1677433721870863400 | 19.22         | 352.78          | 20.22                  |
| 1677433721970868900 | 19.23         | 354.78          | 21.22                  |

Throughout the write phase, the caller can continue extending the the transaction's data
by adding frames. It's common for writers to be open for many hours or even days.

### Commit Phase

Once we're ready to persist the transaction and make it available for reads, we call
the `commit` method on our writer. During this phase, the cluster identifies the time 
range of the writer based on the provided starting timestamp and the samples written. 
The commit process succeeds and the write is now available for reads. After this
phase completes, the transaction is moved back into the write phase. At this
point, we can either write more frames to the cluster and commit again, or we
can close the writer.

#### Auto Commit

If the writer is configured with auto-commit on, every write is immediately committed
and available for reads. This method is useful for real-time data that does not need
to be applied atomically.

### Close Phase

Once done writing, the user can close the writer and release all of it's
resources. All un-committed writes will be lost. Closing a writer will also release
control of the channel to the next highest authority writer, if one exists
(see [Dynamic Control - Write Authorities](#dynamic-control---write-authorities)).

## Persistence/Streaming Modes

Synnax supports three modes for writing data: persist only, stream only, and stream + persist. 

When a writer is opened in **persist only** mode, the data it writes will not be sent to 
streamers listening on the channel being written to. These writers can not be used for 
real-time consumption or monitoring. Persist only mode is commonly used when writing 
historical data to a cluster that doesn't represent the current state of the hardware system.

When opened in **stream only** mode, the writer will not commit any written data to the cluster,
and calls to `commit` will have no effect. This is useful when operating in scenarios
where data is only needed for real-time consumption, but does not need to be accessed
historically.

Finally, when opened in stream + persist mode, the writer will both persist the samples
and stream them to any streamers listening on the channel. This is the default mode for 
a writer.

## Dynamic Control - Write Authorities

Synnax supports multi-writer control transfer over a single channel. This enables patterns
such as:

- Handoff between a manual operator and automated system.
- Handoff between multiple manual operators.
- Handoff between multiple automated systems, such as nominal control loops and abort sequences. 

The control handoff mechanism is based on numeric authorities between 0 and 255, where 
0 is the lowest authority and 255 is the highest. When a writer is opened, the user
can specify an authority for all channels in the writer, or for each channel individually.

When multiple writers are open on the same channel, the writer with a higher authority
will have control. If a new writer is opened with a strictly higher authority, it will
take control from the previous writer. After a higher authority writer is closed, control
will be returned to the next highest authority writer.

### Example - Manual Operator & Abort Sequence

To illustrate this, consider the following scenario:

1. Writer A opens on channel `my-channel` with authority 100.
2. Writer B, which listens for abort conditions, opens on channel `my-channel` with 
authority 50. Writer A remains in control.
4. Writer A writes a number of samples to the channel, which commands an actuator. 
5. Writer B detects an abort condition and sets its authority to 250. Writer B now
takes control of the channelData, and moves the system into a safe state.
6. A manual operator (writer C) opens on channel `my-channel` with authority 255, taking
absolute control of the system to make adjustments.
7. Writers B and C close, returning control to writer A.
