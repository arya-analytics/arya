	// bound is calculated using the opposite approach (i.e. finding the index of the
	// timestamp greater than or equal to the end timestamp and the index of the
	// timestamp less than or equal to the start timestamp). Naturally, a time range
	// whose start timestamp and end timestamps are both known will have an equal lower
